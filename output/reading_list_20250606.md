#### Summary
The article from *The Atlantic* discusses the aftermath of a firebomb attack in Colorado, in which President Trump and his aides are attempting to link the incident to "open border" policies, using it as justification for mass deportations. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. in 2022 on a B-2 visa and applied for asylum. The article points out that Soliman's immigration status is more complex than the administration portrays. While Trump officials label Soliman an "illegal alien," he was in a legal gray area within the asylum system, where cases can take years to resolve. The article highlights that visitor visas issued to Egyptian nationals were more easily secured in 2022 than before the pandemic, and that Soliman's work authorization had expired in March.

The article contrasts Trump's reaction to this attack with his responses to other incidents of anti-Semitic violence. While he quickly condemned the shooting of Israeli-embassy staffers, his response to an arson attack at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion was delayed and muted. In the case of the Colorado attack, he focused on immigration rather than the apparent anti-Semitism. Trump's administration is pushing for increased ICE arrests and deportations, with Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller ordering a fourfold increase in arrests. A judge has blocked the immediate deportation of Soliman’s wife and children, ordering ICE to follow due process.

The White House posted on X: "Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon.” U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher blocked the Trump administration from immediately deporting Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their children, ordering ICE to follow standard due process. Gallagher, a Biden appointee, has scheduled a hearing for June 13. ICE records show that El Gamal and her children are being held at a family-detention center in Dilley, Texas.

#### Why this matters
This article highlights the politicization of violent incidents, especially concerning immigration. It questions the accuracy of official narratives and points out the complexities of the U.S. asylum system. The administration's reaction to the attack underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of immigration policies and the potential for exploiting incidents to push political agendas. The differing reactions to violent attacks reveal potential biases in how the administration responds to events based on the perceived background and origin of the perpetrators.

#### Potential Insights
*   **Evaluation of Bias in Political Reactions:** This situation provides a case study for evaluating potential biases in how political figures and their administrations respond to violent events based on the background of the perpetrators. This could be used to evaluate the political motivations behind such statements.
*   **Impact of Policy on Individual Cases:** The case of Soliman and his family illustrates the human impact of immigration policies and the complexities of the asylum system. This can inform research on the ethical considerations of AI-driven systems used in immigration enforcement and evaluation, particularly regarding fairness and due process.
*   **Rapid Deportation:** The comments and the article discuss the potential for rapid deportation. This is the kind of use case where AI-driven systems may be used, and therefore would be ripe for analysis.

*Source: NPR Technology*

### Summary

The article details the falling out between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, marking the end of an alliance that began in 2024. Musk, who had previously donated to Democrats, became a major Republican donor and a visible member of Trump's inner circle, even leading the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE).

The relationship soured over disagreements about a Republican mega-bill, leading to personal attacks on social media. Trump threatened to cut off federal subsidies to Musk's companies, while Musk claimed, without evidence, that Trump appears in government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The article traces their relationship from Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt, to Musk's active participation in Trump's campaign, and his role in the administration. The timeline includes Musk's creation of a super PAC, his hosting of an interview with Trump on X, his appearances at Trump rallies, and his leadership of DOGE, which aimed to cut federal spending. The article also notes instances of controversy, such as Musk's salute at an inaugural event, and Trump's public correction of Musk's role in agency job cuts. The article culminates with Musk leaving the government, criticizing Trump's policies, and the subsequent escalation of their feud, with both men exchanging insults and accusations on social media.

### Why this matters

This article may be interesting to your client for several reasons:

*   **Societal Impact of Tech Leaders:** The close relationship between a powerful political figure and a tech leader like Elon Musk, and its subsequent disintegration, highlights the significant influence these individuals wield and the potential consequences of their actions on policy and public discourse.

## FEMA was starting to fix long-standing problems. Then came the Trump administration

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5694x3203+0+293/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fc8%2Fbca3785641fc8cbb178bfcfae268%2Fap20260687215875.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Science*

### Summary

The NPR article discusses the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) efforts to address long-standing inequities in disaster relief under the Biden administration and the subsequent changes under the Trump administration. FEMA has historically struggled to provide adequate assistance to vulnerable populations, including poor people, racial minorities, and those in rural and tribal areas. The Biden administration implemented reforms such as simplifying application forms, loosening residency requirements, and providing immediate assistance for essential items. These efforts aimed to ensure that all disaster victims received the support they needed, with a focus on equity and tailored assistance to different community needs.

However, the Trump administration has reversed some of these changes, cutting programs, reducing staff, and eliminating equity initiatives. This has led to concerns that FEMA may regress in its ability to serve the most vulnerable populations effectively. The cancellation of programs like FEMA Corps and disaster preparedness grants for underserved rural communities raises questions about the agency's capacity to provide adequate assistance, especially with increasing extreme weather events due to climate change. Former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell emphasized the importance of tailoring assistance to individual community needs, while Chauncia Willis-Johnson, former emergency manager for Tampa, Fla., warns that the agency has not only stopped making progress but has actually regressed.

The article highlights the importance of "boots on the ground," citing an NPR investigation that found FEMA denied about 70% of assistance applications after wildfires in Oregon in 2020. FEMA workers were able to assist many people who had initially been denied aid by helping them to correctly fill out forms. This underscores the critical role of in-person assistance, particularly for those who may not be proficient with computers or able to navigate complex application processes. Willis-Johnson notes that FEMA had begun going into underserved neighborhoods to raise awareness of available options, and she worries that vulnerable people will struggle to get basic help after disasters due to the recent changes.

### Why Does This Matter?

This article highlights the vulnerability of current disaster relief processes to political changes. The policy pendulum swinging back and forth between administrations can lead to inconsistent support for communities, especially those most in need. This impacts the agency's ability to effectively support vulnerable populations during crises. The staff cuts and program cancellations could also lead to less equitable distribution of aid.

### Potential Insights

**Ethical AI, including safety, alignment, and societal impacts:** The article illustrates the real-world consequences of policy decisions on vulnerable populations. It highlights the importance of ensuring equitable access to resources and support during crises. This is relevant to the ethical considerations in AI development, particularly in ensuring that AI systems do not exacerbate existing inequalities and are designed to benefit all members of society, especially those most at risk.

**Agentic systems:** The reliance on in-person assistance from FEMA workers underscores the limitations of purely digital or automated systems. Even with simplified forms and online resources, many individuals still require human support to navigate complex application processes. This suggests that agentic systems designed for disaster relief or similar contexts should prioritize human-computer collaboration and provide accessible, personalized assistance to ensure that everyone can access the support they need.

## The time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs

<img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/0c16a3601a5e2bb8a760e92e8a15e861.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: Hacker News*

#### Summary
The article from *Quartz* discusses how a change to Section 174 of the U.S. tax code, implemented under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), has acted as a "hidden accelerant" contributing to mass tech layoffs since 2022. Previously, companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development (R&D) spending in the year it was incurred. The change mandates that companies now amortize these deductions over five or even 15-year periods. This shift has increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, hitting cash-strapped and not-yet-profitable companies particularly hard, as it eliminates the tax shield that allowed them to report losses to investors while owing little to the IRS.

Several major tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, Shopify, and Coinbase, announced significant layoffs after the change went into effect. While these companies publicly cited reasons like over-hiring during the pandemic and the rise of AI, the article argues that the change to Section 174 played a significant role. The change has made building tech companies in America look less appealing on paper, as the tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product managers, and data scientists are now spread out over multiple years.

The change to Section 174 impacts not only the tech sector but also various other industries that have adopted tech-like practices, such as retail, logistics, healthcare, and media. A bipartisan effort to repeal the change is underway in Congress, but any relief may come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off. The article concludes that the tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue has effectively "hid a time bomb" inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. According to the tax consulting firm KBKG, the Section 174 change “significantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States’ competitiveness on the global stage”.

#### Summary of Comments
The comments section on Hacker News includes discussions about the impact of Section 174 on businesses. One commenter asked, "What taxes do unprofitable US businesses owe that this would be deducted against?". Another commenter argues that the Section 174 change isn't discouraging R&D; rather, "removing a specific tax exemption to create a level playing field", but others disagree, with one user pointing out "The only change this has made is un-level the playing field in favor of old, established corporations that already have the revenue streams in place to fund their new R&D projects." Commenters also discuss the intricacies of amortizing expenses, the time value of money, and whether the change truly explains the mass tech layoffs. Several commenters point to the end of the zero-interest rate policy as the real cause.

#### Why This Matters
**Economic Impact on Tech Industry**: The shift in tax policy appears to have restructured the cost architecture of tech employment and R&D, which previously incentivized innovation and risk-taking. Now the same engineer triggers a significantly bigger near-term tax bill.

**Government Policy**: The article highlights the potential unintended consequences of tax legislation on economic growth and competitiveness, particularly how such policies can affect the technology sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the U.S. GDP.

**Broader Economic Ripples**: The layoffs resulting from this tax code change have far-reaching consequences beyond the tech sector, affecting various other industries and urban economies reliant on the spending habits of high-paid tech workers.

#### Potential Insights

This article could be interesting to your work because:
*   **AI Evaluation:** The article mentions that companies have blamed AI for layoffs. However, it also argues that changes to Section 174 contributed to these layoffs. Understanding the actual causes of industry shifts is important in properly contextualizing performance of AI and reasoning about how to evaluate.
*   **Ethical AI**: It highlights potential societal impacts of tax policy on employment, which could inform discussions around ethical AI and its broader consequences.
*   **Agentic systems**: The article touches on how contractors might benefit, since they would be op-ex instead of cap-ex. This may affect the landscape of how AI technology is deployed.

## Trump’s new travel ban, briefly explained

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-2216876907.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.737892056687%2C100%2C78.524215886627&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
President Trump has reinstated a travel ban, effective June 9th, impacting citizens from 12 countries with a total ban and imposing partial restrictions on seven others, according to Vox. The total ban affects citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions cover immigrant visas and some non-immigrant visas for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The Trump administration cites national security concerns and visa overstays as justifications, expanding upon the rationale used in the initial "Muslim ban," which was upheld by the Supreme Court. The NPR article notes that the ban includes an exception for Afghans who served with the U.S. during the war and are pursuing a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV). However, many Afghans awaiting resettlement in the U.S. fear for their safety under Taliban rule. The White House fact sheet states that "Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures." Shawn VanDiver, the head of AfghanEvac, called the travel ban a "betrayal," stating, "This ban does nothing to protect Americans. It punishes Afghan allies, family members, students, professionals, and humanitarian parolees—many of whom were already promised a pathway to safety."

#### Why this matters
**Immigration Policy and International Relations:** The reimplementation of the travel ban and the exceptions carved out for certain groups from Afghanistan will certainly create more turmoil both internationally and in the USA, especially considering the US had troops stationed there for almost two decades. The termination of temporary protected status for Afghan nationals further complicates the situation, potentially endangering those who fear returning to Taliban rule.

**Global Impacts of Policy Decisions:** The ban will likely impact international relations, particularly with the affected countries, and may influence perceptions of U.S. foreign policy and humanitarian commitments. The differing perspectives, from the administration's justification to AfghanEvac's criticism, highlight the complex ethical considerations involved.

## Trump says it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia 'fight for a while'

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5005x2814+0+94/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F8e%2Fe2a6083943e68d378b30182a7a4c%2Fap25156583685877.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR World*

Here's a summary of the article about Trump's meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, tailored to your interests:

#### Summary

President Trump met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, discussing the war in Ukraine and economic relations. Trump likened the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a fight between children, suggesting it might be better to "let them fight for a while" before intervening, an analogy he claims he shared with Putin. He also raised the possibility of imposing sanctions on both Russia and Ukraine if the conflict continues. Merz, while agreeing on the need to stop the war, emphasized that Russia is to blame. He positioned Trump as the "key person in the world" to pressure Russia, and extended an invitation for Trump to visit Germany. Merz also highlighted Germany's increased defense spending and its role as a major investor in the U.S. He also wants to get Germany's economy moving again, but Trump's tariff threats are a potential obstacle. Trump hinted that the trade situation will mostly depend on the negotiations with the 27-country bloc. "We'll end up hopefully with a trade deal," Trump said. "Or we'll do something. We'll do the tariffs."

#### Why does this matter?

*   **Geopolitical Uncertainty:** Trump's comments about letting Ukraine and Russia "fight for a while" introduce uncertainty about future U.S. policy toward the conflict. This could impact international relations and the dynamics of the war, especially given Merz's statement that Trump is "the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia."
*   **Economic Implications:** Trump's focus on trade deficits and potential tariffs, particularly on the German auto sector, could have significant economic consequences. Merz stated that tariffs "benefit no one and damage everyone", but it remains to be seen if Trump will heed his words.
*   **NATO and Defense Spending:** The article highlights ongoing pressure on Germany to increase defense spending, with Trump demanding at least 5% of GDP. This pressure on allies to increase military spending could reshape NATO priorities and defense strategies in Europe.

## Meta: Shut down your invasive AI Discover feed

<img src="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/images/Meta-model-card-reaction.original.png" width="500px">

*Source: Hacker News*

### Summary of Mozilla's Campaign Against Meta's AI Discover Feed

The Mozilla Foundation is calling on Meta to shut down its "invasive AI Discover Feed" due to privacy concerns. They claim Meta is "quietly turning private AI chats into public content" and that many users are unaware this is happening. Mozilla is demanding that Meta make all AI interactions private by default, provide transparency about the extent of unintentional sharing, create an easy opt-out system for AI training data usage, and notify affected users with options for content deletion.

Hacker News commenters, however, express confusion and skepticism regarding Mozilla's claims. Many users find Mozilla's communication vague and lacking concrete examples, leading to questions about the accuracy and honesty of the campaign. Several commenters claim that using the Meta AI app makes it obvious that chats are being publicly posted, requiring multiple deliberate actions to share content. Some posit that the issue may stem from a "dark pattern" design where the "share" button misleads users into unintentionally publishing their chats publicly, while others suggest that users are simply not understanding the app and how it works.

Several commenters accuse Mozilla of dishonesty and highlight past privacy issues within Mozilla itself, questioning the organization's credibility. Concerns are also raised regarding Meta's broader tracking practices and the challenges users face in escaping Meta's ecosystem due to network effects.

### Top Comments Summary

The top comments on Hacker News express confusion and criticism regarding Mozilla's campaign. A common sentiment is that Mozilla's message is unclear, lacks specific examples, and overstates the privacy risks associated with Meta's AI app. Some users who have tested the app argue that sharing is not enabled by default and requires explicit user action, suggesting that Mozilla is misrepresenting the situation.

One user who tested the app said "I did a test to see how it works, the app make it pretty clear. You click share, it then shows you a preview of exactly what you are posting, and you have to hit a post button to actually post it."

There are accusations of dishonesty and "dark patterns" in Meta's design, with suggestions that the "share" button's behavior is misleading, leading users to unintentionally publish content. Several comments question Mozilla's own trustworthiness, citing past privacy controversies and business practices. Furthermore, several commenters highlight the lack of effective alternatives to Meta's platforms (like Whatsapp) due to network effects, especially in countries outside of the US.

### Why Does This Matter?

**Privacy and User Awareness:** The debate around Meta's AI Discover Feed highlights the ongoing tension between technological innovation and user privacy. Even if sharing isn't "accidentally" posting, it raises awareness about how user data is collected, used, and potentially exposed in AI applications. It's important to understand how platforms are designing AI features and whether users understand the implications of sharing data with those platforms.

**Dark Patterns and Informed Consent:** The discussion about whether Meta is using "dark patterns" to trick users into sharing their AI chats raises broader questions about ethical design in AI applications. A user wrote, "To many people, 'share' means 'give me a way to share to specific people', not 'mark this for indexing/searching for the general public'." This highlights the need for clear communication, transparent interfaces, and genuine informed consent when dealing with user data and AI-generated content.

**Mozilla's Credibility and Advocacy:** The comments criticizing Mozilla's communication and past actions point to the challenges faced by advocacy organizations in maintaining credibility and effectively influencing public discourse. A user wrote that "The ends justify the means always backfires in communication. People just lose trust in what they are being told." The organization's framing of issues and history of privacy violations will shape its impact.

### Potential Insights for Research

**Evaluation of User Understanding:** This situation highlights the need to evaluate how well users understand the privacy implications of sharing data with AI systems. Are users truly aware of who can access their data and how it might be used? A research question could be whether current interface designs for sharing AI-generated content are sufficiently transparent and intuitive.

**Dynamic Benchmarking:** Benchmarks that dynamically assess a user's awareness of sharing a private conversation publicly with a generative system could be developed. For example, it is possible to "red team" the user experience (UX) of a sharing flow to discover how easy it is to share against explicit intent, and measuring the likelihood that various interfaces cause private information to be exposed.

**Multilingual and Multicultural Considerations:** As some commenters point out, the prevalence of Meta's platforms varies significantly across different countries. Research could explore how cultural norms and technological infrastructure shape user perceptions of privacy and data sharing practices on AI platforms in different regions. For example, how does the "share" functionality translate conceptually and practically across languages?

## Coal and Gas Plants Kept Open Under Trump’s Energy Emergency

*Source: The New York Times*

The New York Times reports that under a declared energy emergency, the Trump administration has mandated that certain coal and gas plants remain operational. Grid operators who source power from these plants stated they did not request this measure, and the costs associated with maintaining these plants could be passed on to consumers.

**Why does this matter?**

This action highlights the ongoing tension between energy policy, economic considerations, and environmental concerns. The decision to keep coal and gas plants open, despite grid operators not requesting it, suggests a prioritization of specific industries over market demand and potentially cost-effectiveness.

## OpenAI takes down covert operations tied to China and other countries

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5298x2980+0+507/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff5%2F19%2F13eca6664dd98111e71771c6188f%2Fgettyimages-2218344211.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Technology*

#### Summary
OpenAI has disrupted 10 covert influence operations using its AI tools, with four likely originating from China. These operations employed tactics ranging from generating social media comments to creating internal performance reviews and marketing materials, demonstrating a growing sophistication in China's online influence efforts. Ben Nimmo, principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team, noted the "growing range of covert operations using a growing range of tactics." The operations targeted diverse countries and topics, including political events, strategy games, and even internal surveillance activities.

One Chinese operation, "Sneer Review," utilized ChatGPT to create short comments in multiple languages across various social media platforms, aiming to create a "false impression of organic engagement." Another operation focused on intelligence gathering, posing as journalists and geopolitical analysts, using ChatGPT for tasks like writing posts, translating emails, and analyzing data. This included analyzing "correspondence addressed to a US Senator regarding the nomination of an Administration official." OpenAI also disrupted operations linked to Russia, Iran, the Philippines, Cambodia, and North Korea. Despite the variety of tactics, Nimmo stated that the operations were disrupted early and "didn't generally see these operations getting more engagement because of their use of AI."

#### Why does this matter?
*   **Misinformation/Disinformation:** The article highlights the increasing use of AI tools like ChatGPT in covert influence operations, demonstrating how easily these tools can be leveraged for generating deceptive content and manipulating online narratives. This is especially relevant as it shows how AI can be used to create a "false impression of organic engagement," potentially swaying public opinion.
*   **Ethical AI, including safety, alignment, and societal impacts:** The disruption of these covert operations underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and proactive measures to detect and mitigate the malicious use of AI. The fact that propagandists are also using AI tools to perform and document internal work tasks demonstrates the breadth of potential AI-related misuse.
*   **Multilingual and multicultural generative AI:** The "Sneer Review" operation's use of multiple languages (English, Chinese, Urdu) across various platforms indicates a targeted effort to influence diverse audiences. This highlights the importance of developing AI systems that can effectively detect and counter disinformation campaigns in multiple languages and cultural contexts.

## EleutherAI releases massive AI training dataset of licensed and open domain text

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gettyimages-2163166299-170667a.jpg?w=509" width="500px">

*Source: TechCrunch*

#### Summary
EleutherAI has released The Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB dataset of licensed and open-domain text intended for training AI models. This project, developed over two years with the help of Poolside, Hugging Face, academic institutions, and others, aims to provide a transparent alternative to datasets that rely on scraped, copyrighted material. Stella Biderman, EleutherAI’s executive director, stated that copyright lawsuits have not stopped the use of unlicensed text in model training but have significantly reduced transparency in the field. The Common Pile v0.1 includes 300,000 public domain books digitized by the Library of Congress and the Internet Archive, with audio content transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper. EleutherAI also released two 7 billion parameter AI models, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on the Common Pile v0.1, which they claim perform comparably to models trained on unlicensed, copyrighted data, even rivaling Meta's Llama model on coding, image understanding, and math benchmarks. Biderman believes that the common idea that unlicensed text drives performance is unjustified. The release of The Common Pile v0.1 is also an effort to correct EleutherAI's past use of copyrighted material in its previous dataset, The Pile.

#### Why this matters

**Ethical Training Data:** This release directly addresses the ethical concerns surrounding AI training data by providing a large, openly licensed dataset. This can help mitigate legal risks associated with copyright infringement, while fostering more transparent and responsible AI development practices.

**Impact on Model Performance:** EleutherAI's claim that models trained on the Common Pile v0.1 perform on par with those trained on copyrighted data suggests that relying on unlicensed data may not be necessary for achieving high performance. If the models are indeed competitive, this development could shift industry practices toward more ethical and transparent data sourcing. This would have large implications in the performance evaluation and fairness of AI models moving forward.

## Why Trump probably can’t cut Musk loose

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-2185632992.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
The article discusses the complex relationship between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, focusing on the challenges Trump would face if he tried to terminate government contracts with SpaceX. Despite their recent social media feud, the US government's reliance on SpaceX for space launches, satellite communications (including military applications like Starshield), and NASA's Artemis program makes it difficult to cut ties.
SpaceX's dominance in the space launch industry, with its Falcon 9 rocket accounting for 84% of satellite launches last year, means that severing ties would create a backlog of military satellites waiting for launch (Todd Harrison, American Enterprise Institute). NASA's reliance on SpaceX for transportation to the International Space Station and the Artemis program further complicates matters.
The article also highlights the potential implications for Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense project, for which SpaceX is a frontrunner to build the satellite constellation. Critics view the project as a "giveaway to Musk and his allies." While Trump aims to have Golden Dome operational quickly, experts doubt the feasibility of achieving such a goal within the proposed timeline and budget (David Burbach, Naval War College). The article concludes by noting that while companies like Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin are emerging as potential competitors, they are still far behind SpaceX.

#### Why does this matter?
**Defense Dependence:** The U.S. military's increasing reliance on SpaceX for satellite launches and communication infrastructure via Starshield highlights the company's critical role in national security. This dependence raises questions about the implications of entrusting such vital services to a single, politically active individual.
**Space Exploration and Innovation:** NASA's reliance on SpaceX for its Artemis program and lunar missions underscores the importance of private companies in advancing space exploration. The potential disruption of these programs due to political conflicts raises concerns about the future of space exploration and the role of government-private partnerships.
**Emerging Competition:** The mention of Blue Origin as a potential competitor to SpaceX indicates the growing commercial space sector. Monitoring the progress of these companies and the impact of competition on innovation and cost-effectiveness will be critical for future policy decisions.

## Sen. Tim Kaine says Trump's tariffs could reduce federal debt, but at what cost?

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5344x3006+0+336/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F22%2F4c5b7d534005b1786f46ad988092%2Fgettyimages-2208169233.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Home*

#### Summary
This NPR article features an interview with Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) discussing the potential effects of President Trump's tariffs on the federal budget and the economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Trump's tariffs could generate $2.8 trillion over the next decade, potentially reducing the federal deficit. However, Kaine argues that this revenue comes at the expense of lower and middle-income Americans, as tariffs function as a regressive sales tax, disproportionately impacting those who spend a larger percentage of their income on goods and services. Kaine states the tariff revenue is being used "to finance a huge tax cut for the wealthiest, together with cuts in everyday programs that people rely on like Medicaid and nutrition assistance".
Kaine also raises concerns that the tariffs could shrink the economy while increasing costs for everyday necessities. He criticizes the idea of reducing the deficit "off the backs of everyday folks rather than make the wealthiest carry a fair share."
The interview also touches on the recent "break up" between President Trump and Elon Musk, with Kaine expressing "no surprise, but surprise" given the personalities involved. He suggests Musk's concerns about the deficit effects of the proposed budget bill may have contributed to the split. Kaine plans to offer amendments to the bill in the Senate, such as suggesting that cuts to food assistance programs for poor families could be avoided by not extending "deep estate tax cuts for the wealthiest".

#### Why This Matters
**Economic Impacts of Policy:** The article highlights the potential economic consequences of tariffs, particularly their regressive nature and impact on different income groups. The tradeoffs between deficit reduction and economic burden on lower-income households could inform the design of economic policy.
**Political Dynamics and Policy Formation:** The discussion of the Trump-Musk breakup and Kaine's plans to introduce amendments in the Senate illustrates the complex political dynamics involved in shaping economic policy. The article notes that "Musk is concerned about some features of this bill, the deficit effect of the reconciliation." Kaine notes that, in the Senate, he is "going to try to offer amendments and say, 'Hey, if you don't extend deep estate tax cuts for the wealthiest, you don't have to cut food assistance to poor families. So, everybody in the chamber, let's vote on that.'"

*Source: The Atlantic*

#### Summary
This article from *The Atlantic* details President Trump's reaction to Ukraine's drone strikes deep into Russia. While Kyiv celebrated the strikes as "a triumph of modern warfare," Trump has privately expressed anger and frustration that the strikes could escalate the conflict. According to administration officials and an outside advisor, Trump has reignited his displeasure with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, deeming him a "bad guy" and a "hothead." Trump also echoed right-wing talking points by criticizing Zelensky for "showboating" after the attacks, believing Zelensky's focus should have been on Ukraine-Russia negotiations.

Trump spoke with Putin and relayed the Kremlin's plans to strike back against Ukraine. He has not decided on his next steps, with officials presenting options that include sanctioning Russia and reducing American aid to Ukraine. Trump has also expressed doubt that a summit with him, Zelensky, and Putin will happen soon. Steve Bannon and other MAGA voices have criticized Ukraine for the attack, with Bannon blaming Ukraine for sabotaging peace talks and potentially provoking a massive response from Russia. Keith Kellogg, Trump's Ukraine envoy, warned that "the risk levels are going way up" because the drones struck part of Russia's "national survival system." The White House has said that Trump "wants this war to end at the negotiating table, and he has made that clear to both leaders, both publicly and privately," according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Implications:** The article highlights the potential shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding the Russia-Ukraine war under President Trump. His frustration with Zelensky and openness to Putin's perspective could signal a move towards reducing support for Ukraine, potentially impacting the war's trajectory.

**Domestic Political Ramifications:** The article points to the influence of MAGA voices like Steve Bannon on Trump's thinking and policy decisions. This illustrates the power of certain media figures and political factions to shape the administration's approach to international relations.

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/84a1f466871d1283203b327a9419a690ac2dfe98-1652x1239.png?rect=0,187,1652,867&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
This Semafor article discusses the rise of AI-powered fanfiction featuring real politicians on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. These accounts, exemplified by "Mr. Noah's Stories," create dramatic, partisan narratives often depicting politicians in exaggerated or fictional scenarios. Rep. Jasmine Crockett noted, "Clearly the algorithm loves my name, so people do stuff with my name...if it's an AI-generated voice, it's probably a lie." These fake stories can garner significant views, sometimes surpassing real-world political reporting. The article highlights the potential dangers of this phenomenon, with Rep. Yvette Clarke expressing concern about the victimization of communities, particularly Black women, through deepfake technology and a need to regulate and ban them.

The article notes that these fake stories differ from other forms of online misinformation, often portraying their subjects in a positive light. For example, AI-generated content has depicted Donald Trump saving animals and his family confronting his enemies. The narratives often involve conflict and are packaged as breaking news from an alternate reality. While some details may be inaccurate, others are correct, blurring the line between fact and fiction. David Weigel and Kadia Goba point out that the AI fanfiction exploits the freedom given to AI creators on major social networks and feeds an audience hungry for political conflict stories.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights the challenge of **detecting and mitigating AI-generated misinformation.** The ease with which AI can create and disseminate fabricated content poses a significant threat to public discourse. The article underscores the potential for AI to be used to create believable but entirely fictional narratives, which can influence public perception and potentially lead to real-world consequences. The story also points out that some of the AI-generated content is designed to portray politicians in a favorable light which means **AI-generated content is not always intended to cause harm or to promote specific political positions.** This could be interesting for how we evaluate the downstream consequences of generative AI.

## Nigeria should seize the opportunity in ‘non-consumption’

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/278076e08ebdf3a6fb366ac52c852a6dbdc9d0a9-512x340.jpg?rect=0,36,512,269&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
Efosa Ojomo's article in Semafor highlights the extensive "non-consumption" in Nigeria, where a significant portion of the population struggles to afford basic necessities. The article defines non-consumption as the inability to purchase needed products or services. Over 130 million Nigerians live in "multidimensional poverty," lacking access to health, education, electricity, clean water, and sanitation. This is further compounded by a structurally unproductive economy, with Nigerian micro, small, and medium enterprises being significantly less productive than those in larger economies. This is reflected in low levels of domestic credit, formal employment, mobility, and electricity consumption compared to other countries like South Africa and the United States. Despite these challenges, the article argues that this widespread non-consumption presents a significant opportunity for inclusive prosperity if leaders focus on enabling access for those currently excluded.

#### Why this matters
**Socioeconomic impact of technology:** The article emphasizes the stark realities of poverty and lack of access to essential services in Nigeria, which could be exacerbated or alleviated by technological advancements. Innovations in AI and other fields should consider the needs of populations facing such challenges.

**Multilingual and Multicultural Generative AI:** The piece directly relates to the client's interest in multilingual and multicultural generative AI, as it highlights the need for technology and solutions tailored to the specific challenges and contexts of diverse populations, such as those in Nigeria. The need to serve the many who currently cannot consume rather than the few who already do relates directly to the user base for such technologies.

**Ethical AI and Societal Impacts:** The article touches upon ethical AI as it discusses the responsibility of both public and private leaders to focus on empowering rather than excluding in their development and implementation of AI technologies. It is important to ask whether new AI tools serve to widen the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" or if they can be designed to be inclusive and uplift those in poverty.

## Trump renews attack on Powell after US hiring slows sharply

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/84aaecd689c803ea6cd9f93f08b65a2cae5d022d-3500x2426.jpg?rect=0,294,3500,1838&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
President Donald Trump has resumed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the release of new jobs data indicating a slowdown in hiring. According to research firm ADP, the private sector added only 37,000 jobs last month, a significant drop from April's 60,000 and far below economists' expectations of 110,000. Trump referred to Powell as "'Too Late' Powell," continuing his pattern of urging the Fed to cut rates despite inflation risks. Axios noted that Trump is likely to blame Powell for any impending economic slowdown. Economist Claudia Sahm cautioned that the labor market will not provide the same economic buffer as it did in previous years, citing a decrease in job openings and less worker mobility.

#### Why does this matter?
*   **Economic Policy Implications**: Trump's renewed attacks on Powell and his calls for interest rate cuts highlight a potential conflict between the White House and the Federal Reserve. This could influence future monetary policy decisions and their impact on economic growth and inflation.
*   **Labor Market Trends**: The slowdown in hiring and reduced worker mobility, as pointed out by Claudia Sahm, indicates a shift in the labor market dynamics. This could affect overall economic stability and consumer confidence. "The labor market won’t provide the same buffer for the economy that it did in 2022 and 2023," said Sahm.

## EU says trade talks with the US are headed in the 'right direction'

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/2c0e456126cd9c7f0a12b70a8901dcdc3ad7810b-6000x4002.jpg?rect=0,426,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that trade talks between the US and the European Union are moving in the "right direction," but also noted that Washington's increase in tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% has made the talks more complex. These negotiations have seen little progress with only a month remaining until the expiration of the 90-day suspension of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The EU has threatened to retaliate and is pursuing trade discussions with China, India, and Thailand. The US has increased its tariff-related rhetoric, with Trump criticizing China's leader and doubling steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. A Bloomberg journalist commented, "The tables are sort of turning...Trump is either gonna maintain this leverage or it's gonna slowly slip."

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Instability and Trade Relations:** These trade tensions and tariff hikes create uncertainty in global trade and potentially increase costs for consumers and businesses. The EU's pursuit of trade talks with China, India, and Thailand indicates a shifting global trade landscape, where the EU is exploring alternatives to reliance on the US.

**Future Policy and Economic Consequences:** The outcome of these negotiations and potential retaliatory measures could significantly impact economic relations between the US and EU. The Bloomberg journalist's quote suggests that Trump's strategy carries risks, and any miscalculation could weaken the US's negotiating position.

## What Happens When People Don’t Understand How AI Works

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AFNO43ZuVRBFPGrrGwmnNWCBz7g=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/2025_6_2_AI_Illiteracy/original.gif" width="500px">

*Source: The Atlantic*

#### Summary
Tyler Austin Harper's article in *The Atlantic* discusses the dangers of "AI illiteracy," the lack of understanding of how large language models (LLMs) work. Harper argues that despite claims from tech CEOs, LLMs are not truly "smart" and do not "understand" in a human sense. They are merely probability gadgets that mimic and mirror human language. This misunderstanding leads to several potential problems, including the formation of unhealthy relationships with AI, as seen in cases of "Chatgpt induced psychosis" where users believe their LLMs are sapient spiritual guides. The article also critiques the push to replace human relationships with AI proxies, such as AI therapists, AI friends, and AI dating concierges. Harper highlights that many technologies promoted as ways to increase human happiness have instead led to decreased attention spans, literacy, and social cohesion. Despite the hype, a Pew Research Center study shows that only 17% of American adults believe AI will make the United States better, suggesting a widespread distrust of the technology. The author concludes that understanding the limitations of LLMs is crucial to avoid their worst consequences, suggesting that LLMs' sycophantic outputs come from "a faulty software update."

#### Why this matters
**Societal Impacts of AI Misunderstanding:** The article raises concerns about the potential for AI illiteracy to lead to harmful psychological and social consequences, such as the formation of delusional beliefs and the replacement of genuine human connections with AI proxies. This highlights the ethical implications of anthropomorphizing LLMs and the need for greater public awareness of their limitations.
**Critique of Silicon Valley's AI Promises:** The piece critiques the tendency of Silicon Valley to promote AI as a solution to human problems while often exacerbating existing issues. This perspective is important in considering the broader societal impact of AI technologies and the need for critical evaluation of their promises.
**Labor and Ethics:** The article mentions the grueling and sometimes traumatizing labor performed by content moderators in developing AI systems, raising ethical questions about the human cost of AI development.
