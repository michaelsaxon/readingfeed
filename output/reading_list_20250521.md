Here's a summary and analysis of the Nippon Steel/US Steel deal, tailored to your interests:

#### Summary

Nippon Steel is now offering an additional $11 billion investment in US Steel, a significant increase from the initial $2.7 billion, in an attempt to secure the deal's approval from the US government. This investment includes roughly $1 billion for a new "greenfield" steel mill, intended to create or protect tens of thousands of jobs. The location of this new facility is yet to be determined, but likely near US Steel's existing facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. The Japanese government is also involved and may backstop some of the spending.

This move comes as Nippon Steel navigates opposition from Donald Trump, who has publicly stated his preference against the deal ("We don’t want to see it go to Japan"). Despite the increasing cost and political hurdles, Nippon Steel seems determined to close the deal, indicating a belief that tariffs are here to stay and that this investment is necessary to maximize productivity. A national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States expires soon. Cleveland Cliffs' potential competing bid has faded due to its own internal issues.

#### Why Does This Matter?

**Economic and Political Landscape:** This deal highlights the complex interplay between international trade, domestic politics, and economic incentives. The willingness of Nippon Steel to significantly increase its investment to overcome political opposition underscores the potential long-term strategic value they see in US Steel, as well as the perceived need to adapt to a potentially protectionist trade environment. This case demonstrates how political considerations and potential policy shifts (like tariffs) can heavily influence business decisions and investment strategies.

**Global Industrial Trends:** The commitment to a "greenfield" steel mill is notable at a time when many companies are closing such facilities. This could signal a strategic bet on the future of steel production in the US, potentially driven by factors such as government incentives, regional demand, or technological advancements in steel manufacturing. The reference to the involvement of former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer suggests that this deal might be tied to broader trade agreements.

*Source: TechCrunch*

#### Summary
The Department of the Interior is initiating the process of selling deep-sea mining leases following a request from the startup Impossible Metals. This process involves evaluating a potential mineral lease sale offshore of American Samoa, requiring a publication in the federal register and a solicitation of public feedback. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that accessing deep-sea mineral resources supports American economic growth and national security, emphasizing the importance of critical minerals ("Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation’s resilience and safeguarding our national interests," Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said). Impossible Metals has developed an autonomous underwater vehicle that uses robotic claws to extract polymetallic nodules, claiming a less disruptive approach compared to competitors. These nodules contain high concentrations of minerals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper, essential for electrification.

However, ecologists and oceanographers warn that deep-sea mining could disrupt fragile ecosystems, with slow recovery rates. A recent study indicated that microbial communities might take 50 years to recover from such operations. The mining robots could directly harm sponges and other sea creatures, and sediment plumes could pollute the water. Furthermore, the nodules themselves produce oxygen, ("the nodules themselves produce oxygen, suggesting they may help researchers find life on other planets") raising concerns about the broader environmental impact.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights a potential conflict between economic interests and environmental concerns. The push for critical minerals to support electrification and national security is juxtaposed with the potential ecological damage caused by deep-sea mining. The article introduces a specific company, Impossible Metals, and their technological approach, as well as the ecological risks as described by scientists.

#### Relevance to your research
*   **AI Evaluation:** Impossible Metals claims their mining approach is less disruptive. It would be interesting to evaluate these claims rigorously, potentially employing methods to assess the environmental impact and comparing it to alternative mining techniques. The reliance on "autonomous underwater vehicles" also presents a unique case study for evaluating the capabilities and reliability of AI systems in extreme environments.
*   **Ethical AI, including safety, alignment, and societal impacts:** There are potential societal impacts associated with the environmental disruption, affecting communities that rely on the ocean ecosystem. The decision-making process of deploying these autonomous systems raises ethical questions about long-term ecological consequences and the responsibility of developers and regulators. It is especially important to ask whether the evaluation of these systems considers ecological impact in any rigorous way.

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/bc1d6094821036b87d6c392a12fa65ad19fb7761-4032x2683.jpg?rect=0,284,4032,2117&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, managing $1.8 trillion, is scaling back hiring due to efficiency gains from artificial intelligence. CEO Nicolai Tangen informed the Norwegian Parliament that increased technology use, including AI, is enabling more efficient operations. Tangen noted that compiling reports in 16 languages, which previously took days, now takes only 10 minutes due to AI. He has previously cited internal polls claiming a 15% productivity gain from AI. The article also references Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, which reduced its clinical report drafting team from 50 to three people using generative AI.

#### Why does this matter?

**AI-Driven Efficiency:** The fund's shift to AI highlights a broader trend of automation impacting traditionally human-driven tasks within large organizations. This shift is not just about cost savings but also about increasing productivity and speed in processing complex information across multiple languages.

**Implications for the Labor Market:** The reduction in hiring by a major financial institution and the significant decrease in personnel at Novo Nordisk due to AI point to potential disruptions in the labor market. These examples indicate that AI is not just augmenting human capabilities but, in some cases, replacing human roles, even in highly skilled areas.

#### Relevance to AI Research

This announcement has implications for multilingual AI research. The fact that the fund is using AI to generate reports in 16 languages, and has seen productivity gains from it, is a demonstration of the possibilities of multilingual AI. This provides an opportunity to analyze the effectiveness of these generated reports and compare the quality with that of human-generated reports.
This can be a step forward for benchmarking and evaluating multilingual parity in AI systems.

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/9bc4940f539d6a0fb170170942100473b899c87b-4515x3010.jpg?rect=0,320,4515,2370&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

### Summary

The article from Semafor highlights growing concerns about the US economy, noting a dip in US stock futures and a rise in Treasury yields, with the 30-year Treasury yield briefly exceeding 5%. Key figures in finance are expressing caution, particularly regarding US government debt and inflation risks. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, suggests that "the risks for US government debt are greater than the rating agencies are conveying." Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, also warned that markets were "underpricing geopolitical and inflation risks." These warnings follow last week’s downgrade of US Treasuries by Moody’s.

### Why does this matter?

This matters due to the potential implications for future economic policy and stability. Dimon's warning about underpricing geopolitical risks could indicate an expectation of increased volatility and uncertainty in the global landscape. The rise in Treasury yields suggests that investors are demanding higher returns to compensate for perceived risks, potentially impacting borrowing costs for the government and businesses. If current geopolitical or inflationary risks are not adequately taken into account, models for assessing markets may need to be updated.

#### Summary

G7 finance ministers, including US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are meeting in Canada to project unity amidst uncertainty over US tariffs. While the Western alliance aims to present a cohesive front on issues like the Ukraine war, China’s industrial capacity, and climate change, analysts predict that any consensus will align with US President Donald Trump’s priorities. "Trade deals with Washington" are unlikely to emerge from the meeting. The joint communique is expected to be vague, with ING warning that any deviation from previous agreements on foreign-exchange policy language could be a "high impact event," potentially affecting the dollar's value. Ahead of the talks, "the euro rose to a 10-day high."

#### Why does this matter?

*   **Economic and Policy Alignment:** The article highlights the tension between the G7's desire for unity and the influence of US trade policies under President Trump. This could influence global trade dynamics and foreign exchange policies, with potential impacts on international financial markets.
*   **International Relations:** The meeting's focus on issues such as the Ukraine war and China’s industrial capacity underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and geopolitics. The lack of consensus on these issues could signal deeper divisions within the G7 alliance.

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Japan's exports to the US experienced a decline in April, marking the first decrease this year, as tariffs imposed by the US began to take effect and trade negotiations lost momentum. Japan, a significant trading partner of the US, was at the forefront of tariff discussions and is particularly susceptible to potential auto tariffs enacted by President Trump. Despite ongoing negotiations, the two countries have not yet achieved a significant breakthrough.

Tokyo has consistently requested that Washington eliminate tariffs, a position emphasized by its chief negotiator this week. Japanese leaders are concerned that making concessions on tariffs would negatively impact their electoral prospects. However, Japan possesses leverage as the largest foreign holder of US debt. According to *Foreign Policy*, both countries have a strong incentive to reach an agreement to avoid failure.

#### Why this matters

**Geopolitical Ramifications:** This situation highlights the ongoing tensions and complexities in international trade relations. The potential for trade disputes to escalate, impacting economic stability and political alliances, is a crucial aspect to monitor. The impact of tariffs and trade policies on specific industries, such as the auto industry, can have far-reaching consequences.

**Economic Impacts:** Understanding the economic vulnerabilities of countries like Japan to US trade policies is essential. This includes analyzing the potential consequences of tariffs on various sectors, supply chains, and overall economic growth. The article also highlights the role of Japan as a major holder of US debt, which provides it with some leverage in negotiations.

## Sanders adviser Stephanie Kelton praises Trump's tax hike suggestion

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/fb5f9abeeb70f550f2f08ce2e9608b2dc4f5e8cf-1191x893.jpg?rect=0,135,1191,625&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The article discusses President Trump's consideration of allowing some tax cuts for higher earners to expire, and the unexpected support he's receiving from Stephanie Kelton, a prominent economist and advisor to Bernie Sanders. Kelton believes that targeting individuals making between $1 million and $2.5 million with a 39.6% tax bracket is "directionally correct" and could help mitigate inflation risks, especially given that the top 10% of Americans account for about half of all consumer spending. Kelton also states that Trump's proposed tax cuts on Social Security, tips and overtime are "likely to be stimulative" and that one "has to think seriously about the potential for inflation."

The article highlights the tension within the Republican party, with figures like Steve Bannon noting that while the electorate has shifted, the party hasn't fully adapted. Bannon stated that the dynamic "shows you [how] much we changed the electorate and how little we’ve changed the party." It also suggests a potential, albeit unlikely, alliance between Trump and Democrats on economic policy. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is quoted as lobbying against any Republican shift toward higher taxes, fearing infighting and potential failure of the bill.

#### Why does this matter?
**Economic Policy Implications:** The potential shift in Trump's tax policy and the support from an economist associated with the left highlight the complexities of economic policy and its potential impact on inflation. It also raises questions about the consistency of political ideologies when dealing with economic realities.
**Political Realignment:** The article suggests a possible realignment in political alliances, where economic policy could bridge the gap between traditionally opposed parties. This challenges the conventional understanding of partisan divides and opens up the possibility of unexpected collaborations.

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
Due to budget cuts at NOAA initiated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, the agency is turning to WindBorne, a Silicon Valley startup, to provide weather balloon data. These cuts forced staff reductions and program shutdowns, impacting the agency's forecasting capabilities, which are crucial for emergency services and applications like the Apple Weather app. WindBorne's AI-powered balloons can stay airborne for weeks, collecting data at a lower overall cost than traditional NOAA balloons, which last only a day.

WindBorne uses satellite connectivity and AI to control the balloons' elevation and steer them to specific locations for data collection. The company aims to have 10,000 balloons in the air, providing global coverage. Currently, data from its 50-60 balloons is sold to traders. John Dean, co-founder and CEO of WindBorne, noted that while the cuts were "reckless," they may ultimately lead to "more data" for weather prediction. Reed Albergotti suggests that Musk's thesis on technology improving efficiency may be justified in this case. However, former National Weather Service chief Louis Uccellini told PBS News that the NOAA cuts could be "disastrous for public safety". The agency has also "aggressively cut" climate research, seemingly driven by politics, according to Bloomberg.

#### Why does this matter?
**Cost-Effective Data Collection**
The shift to AI-powered weather balloons highlights the potential for innovative technologies to provide cost-effective solutions in government operations. This could be a model for other agencies facing budget constraints, demonstrating how AI can improve data collection while reducing expenses.

**Impact of Policy on Forecasting Capabilities**
The article underscores how government policies, like budget cuts, can directly impact critical services such as weather forecasting, which have consequences for public safety and various industries. This may be illustrative of how to predict the impacts of political policy.

**Private Sector Innovation and Government Partnerships**
The partnership between NOAA and WindBorne showcases the potential for collaboration between the government and Silicon Valley startups, potentially leading to more direct engagement with innovative technologies. Dean says that NOAA went from a "hands-off approach to the private sector under the Biden administration to one that is eager for partnerships."

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/0b5e4e6ad62b8d7bf9133410b38c7baf0e3ceb8a-8640x5760.jpg?rect=0,612,8640,4536&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Russia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, resulting in a large-scale prisoner swap of 1000 prisoners of war from each side. However, the talks did not yield a breakthrough in ending the war, as Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraw from territory it still controls, which Ukraine rejects. Moscow's top negotiator stated the Kremlin is "ready to continue contacts" and that both parties agreed to "write down" their visions of a ceasefire deal and continue negotiations. Russia expert Samuel Charap considered the outcome "better than expected" for the first direct talks in 3 years, emphasizing that significant results from the initial meeting were unlikely.

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Implications:** Even though the talks did not lead to a ceasefire, the agreement to continue negotiations suggests a willingness from both sides to explore potential resolutions. This could signal a shift in diplomatic strategies and may influence international relations and alliances in the coming months.

**Humanitarian Impact:** The prisoner swap represents a significant humanitarian achievement, bringing relief to many soldiers and their families. This act could create a foundation of trust between the two nations that could be leveraged for future negotiations.

**War Economy:** The ongoing conflict, now three years in, likely requires continued investment from each side, or foreign allies. The prisoner swap may be a signal to markets that investment and future aid may be reduced in the coming months or years, thus impacting the financial health of involved countries and organizations.

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2173579488.jpg?w=1024" width="500px">

*Source: Hacker News*

#### Summary

Meta is launching the "Llama for Startups" program to encourage the adoption of its Llama AI models. The program offers U.S.-based startups, which have raised less than $10 million and have at least one developer, direct support from Meta’s Llama team and potential funding of up to $6,000 per month for six months to offset development costs. This initiative is part of Meta's strategy to maintain its lead in the open model space amid growing competition from companies like DeepSeek, Google, and Alibaba's Qwen.

The program launch comes despite recent setbacks for Meta’s Llama models, including a delay in the release of Llama 4 Behemoth due to underperformance on benchmarks and allegations of cheating on the LM Arena benchmark. Meta aims to generate significant revenue from its generative AI products, projecting $2 billion to $3 billion in 2025 and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035. These products require substantial investment, with Meta’s "GenAI" budget exceeding $900 million in 2024 and potentially surpassing $1 billion this year, in addition to significant capital expenditures on data centers.

#### Why does this matter?

**Open Model Ecosystem:** Meta's efforts to foster a Llama-based ecosystem via startup support could accelerate the development and deployment of applications leveraging open-source AI models. This dynamic creates opportunities for the broader AI community to experiment and innovate, but also exposes areas for evaluation and benchmark development, to ensure a fair comparison of model performance.

**Competitive Landscape:** The article highlights the intense competition in the open model space and the challenges Meta faces from rivals and benchmarks, and the potential impacts on Meta's future revenue goals. This competitive pressure should push companies to rigorously evaluate models, and improve their ability to avoid or mitigate potential setbacks.

#### Potential Insights

This article highlights the importance of transparent and rigorous model evaluation. The fact that Meta allegedly "optimized for conversationality" on LM Arena, and then released a different version publicly, suggests a need for better methods to measure and communicate the capabilities of language models under different conditions.

The fact that Meta is having to spend over a billion dollars on GenAI suggests the need for research into model efficiency. How can we reduce the computational cost of training and deploying these models, while preserving their capabilities?

#### Comments

The comments are not available, so I cannot provide a summary of them.

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/49fb950e1cb30b61b6bf50c84674783e0f50bde9-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

### Summary

A SignalFire analysis indicates that Big Tech and startups are hiring significantly fewer early career workers as a percentage of their total new hires compared to pre-pandemic levels. The report states that companies are now "posting lower-level roles and hiring more experienced [individuals] to fill them." This shift reverses the trend observed in 2023, when senior-level layoffs temporarily created more entry-level opportunities. The increased adoption of AI tools capable of automating tasks and potentially replacing junior employees is expected to further exacerbate this trend in the coming years. The article highlights the challenge faced by young people attempting to gain experience when companies prioritize candidates who already possess it.

### Why does this matter?

**AI Impact on Entry-Level Roles:** This trend suggests a potentially significant impact of AI-driven automation on the job market for recent graduates, particularly in roles traditionally considered entry-level. It's worth considering how this shift in hiring practices might influence the future talent pool available for AI research and development.

**Experience-Driven Hiring:** The preference for experienced hires over early-career workers could indicate a perceived need for immediate productivity and expertise. This might also suggest that companies are becoming more risk-averse in their hiring strategies, favoring candidates with proven track records over those requiring more training and development.

## UK inflation jumps unexpectedly in April

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/541fbb9289eef7cb845ac0d1b7795e666dbecab5-6938x5464.jpg?rect=0,911,6938,3642&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The UK's inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.5% in April, exceeding the Bank of England's target. The rising costs of household bills, higher food prices, and minimum wage increases were significant contributors. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment, and the Bank of England's chief economist cautioned that interest rate cuts may have been "too rapid" and that long-term shifts in pricing and wage negotiation could sustain higher inflation levels.

In related news, US inflation rose less than expected in April, despite the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. The consumer price index increased by 0.2% for the month, with a 12-month inflation rate of 2.3%. An economist from Morgan Stanley noted that tariff hikes typically have a "lag time before they change prices." Many businesses also imported goods in advance of the tariffs to avoid increased costs.

#### Why does this matter?
This matters because the unexpected rise in UK inflation, coupled with warnings from the Bank of England, signals potential economic instability. The potential impact of tariffs on inflation, as highlighted in the US context, suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing price levels. The Bank of England's chief economist warned that long-term shifts in how businesses set prices and employees negotiate wages could keep "inflation higher for longer."

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

International pressure is building on Russia to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested implementing new sanctions aimed at buyers of Russian oil and financial services. This sentiment is shared by the new German chancellor. Even former President Donald Trump, once seen as sympathetic to the Kremlin, is reportedly growing impatient with Russia's perceived lack of cooperation. One of Trump's allies has proposed a substantial 500% tariff on countries that continue to purchase Russian fuel, a plan that has garnered bipartisan support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to travel to Turkey for peace talks, aiming to demonstrate that Putin is not committed to attending.

#### Why this matters

**Geopolitical Shifts and Economic Implications:** The shift in stance from figures like Trump, alongside potential new sanctions, indicates a possible change in the international political landscape surrounding the conflict. The proposed 500% tariff could significantly impact global energy markets and trade relationships.

**Potential for Negotiation or Escalation:** Zelenskyy's planned peace talks in Turkey, while potentially a positive step, also highlight the current impasse, as Putin has not committed to attending. This may be important for understanding the future of international relations.

Eto acknowledged his "inappropriate remark" amidst consumer struggles with rising prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation as the government attempts to stabilize prices and increase supply, even releasing rice from emergency stockpiles. Eto clarified his comment, stating it referred to brown rice and that he does buy white rice. Opposition lawmakers had threatened a no-confidence motion if Eto didn't resign. Ishiba believes the rice price surge is "not a temporary but a structural problem" and aims to strengthen food security. Shizuko Oshima, 73, said, "Rice is the stable food for the Japanese. When its prices are rising every week, (Eto's) resignation is only natural." The rice shortage began last August due to panic buying after earthquake warnings and has been exacerbated by poor harvests and increased production costs. Experts also blame the government's long-term rice production policy.
