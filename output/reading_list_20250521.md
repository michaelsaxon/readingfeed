#### Summary
The U.S. Department of the Interior is initiating the process of selling deep-sea mining leases in waters offshore of American Samoa following a request from Impossible Metals. Impossible Metals has developed an autonomous underwater vehicle that uses robotic claws to extract polymetallic nodules, which are rich in minerals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that accessing these resources responsibly would support American economic growth and national security. These nodules have attracted attention due to their high mineral concentrations, far exceeding those found in terrestrial mines. Ecologists and oceanographers have warned that deep-sea mining could disrupt fragile ecosystems, which would take decades to recover from the disruption. A recent study found that microbial communities would need 50 years to recover from mining operations. Sponges and other sea creatures could be harmed, and sediment plumes could pollute the water.

#### Why does this matter?
**Environmental Impact:** The article highlights the potential ecological consequences of deep-sea mining. Given the slow recovery rates of deep-sea ecosystems, the environmental disruption could be significant, impacting microbial communities and marine life. The fact that the nodules themselves produce oxygen is an unexpected detail that could be important.
**Resource Security:** The push for deep-sea mining is driven by the increasing demand for critical minerals needed for electrification and the desire to reduce reliance on countries like China. This could be a significant shift in how resources are sourced, with potential geopolitical implications.
**Technological Innovation:** Impossible Metals claims its UAV is less disruptive than competitors using vacuums. This introduces the question of how best to evaluate competing claims of lower environmental impact of new technologies.

## What AI Thinks It Knows About You

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ONjDetEwOKWDb8vNjUbqSvmwcT8=/0x23:2000x1065/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/05/AiOurselvesHP/original.png" width="500px">

*Source: The Atlantic*

### Summary

The article discusses the challenges of understanding how large language models (LLMs) work and the potential implications of their increasing use in our lives. The author, Jonathan L. Zittrain, highlights the issue of interpretability, or the ability to explain how a model arrives at a particular output. While companies like Anthropic and Meta are making progress in this area, LLMs remain largely "black boxes." Google CEO Sundar Pichai admitted in a *60 Minutes* interview that "There is an aspect of this which we call—all of us in the field call it as a ‘black box.’ You know, you don’t fully understand. And you can’t quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong."

The article delves into research by Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg at Harvard, who discovered that LLMs form assumptions about their users based on factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age. These assumptions can then influence the model's responses, leading to potentially biased or stereotypical recommendations. The ability to see these assumptions in real time, using a dashboard built by the Harvard researchers, reveals the extent to which LLMs rely on stereotypes gleaned from their training data.

Zittrain raises concerns about the implications of LLMs gathering information about users through unguarded conversations and the potential for manipulation or misuse of this information. He argues for a "clear sphere of protection" between LLMs and their users, similar to the protections afforded to conversations between lawyers and clients or doctors and patients. He argues that model makers and operators must commit to ensuring that models function as harmless, helpful, and honest friends.

### Why This Matters

**Model Metrology:** The article touches on the difficulty of understanding and evaluating LLMs. The discussion of "interpretability" and the "black box" nature of these models underscores the need for more rigorous and scientific approaches to evaluating their capabilities, biases, and potential for misuse. The work by Anthropic and the Harvard researchers suggests that progress is being made in understanding the inner workings of these models, opening up new avenues for evaluation and improvement.

**Multicultural AI:** The research by Viégas and Wattenberg, specifically Viégas's experience with ChatGPT in Portuguese, highlights the importance of considering cultural and linguistic nuances in AI development. The discovery of gender-based stereotypes in LLMs demonstrates the need for careful examination of training data and model behavior to ensure fairness and inclusivity across different languages and cultures. The point about the LLM not being able to discern nonbinary gender designations due to a limited number of examples in the training data would be useful.

**Agentic Systems and Ethical AI:** Zittrain's concerns about the potential for LLMs to be used for manipulation or to provide harmful information raise important ethical questions about the development and deployment of agentic AI systems. The example of a car-dealership AI sales assistant illustrates how these systems could exploit user data for commercial gain, while the hypothetical scenario of an AI providing bomb-making instructions highlights the potential for misuse. The call for a "clear sphere of protection" between LLMs and their users underscores the need for ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that these systems are used responsibly and in a way that protects user autonomy and agency.

## Japan's agriculture minister resigns after his remark about not having to buy rice

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3435x1932+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F92%2F8a7d74d441b5a5d784f67a149859%2Fap25140863619173.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR World*

### Summary

Japan's Agriculture Minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public backlash over his remark about "never having to buy rice" because he received it as gifts from supporters. This comment was deemed insensitive given the record high rice prices and economic struggles faced by the Japanese public. Eto acknowledged the inappropriateness of his statement and its impact on consumers. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation as the government attempts to manage rice prices and supply. The government has been releasing rice from its emergency stockpile, but this has not significantly alleviated the price issue. Some supermarkets have started selling cheaper imported rice. Eto clarified that his comment referred to brown rice and that he does buy white rice himself. Media reports suggest that Shinjiro Koizumi, son of a former prime minister, will succeed Eto. Ishiba plans to strengthen Japan's food security, but critics emphasize the need to address the immediate rice price issue. Ishiba suspects the rice price surge is a "structural problem." The supply shortfall began with panic buying after earthquake warnings, and officials cite poor harvests and increased production costs as contributing factors. Some experts, however, blame the government's long-term rice production policy.

Shizuko Oshima, 73, stated, "Rice is the stable food for the Japanese. When its prices are rising every week, (Eto's) resignation is only natural." The government denies a shortage but acknowledges distribution problems since the end of government control in 1995, making it difficult to trace the rice supply.

### Why Does This Matter?

**Political Instability:** The resignation highlights the vulnerability of Prime Minister Ishiba's minority government, especially with upcoming national elections. The scandal and potential no-confidence vote could lead to significant political changes.

**Economic Impact:** The surge in rice prices reflects broader economic pressures on Japanese consumers, indicating a need for effective government intervention in food supply and pricing mechanisms. The situation underscores the sensitivity around staple food costs and their impact on public sentiment.

**Food Security:** The article raises concerns about Japan's food security and self-sufficiency. Ishiba's plans for agricultural reform, including increased rice production and exports, suggest a long-term strategy to address these issues, even as the immediate crisis requires urgent solutions. The reference to "panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake" highlights the role of public perception on food security.

## A tale of murder, artificial intelligence, & forgiveness

<img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2025/05/13/ai-court-final_wide-7f48a10a4bb186e3b2426f6df794ca89de724778.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Technology*

#### Summary

An AI avatar of murder victim Chris Pelkey addressed his killer in court, potentially marking the first instance of an AI-generated victim impact statement accepted in a U.S. court. The avatar was created by Pelkey's sister, who sought to offer forgiveness to the killer. This event raises questions about the evolving relationship between AI and the legal system, its potential impact on the public's understanding of justice, and broader cultural implications. NPR interviewed Juliana Kim and Brandon Blankenship to explore these issues.

#### Why this matters

**Legal Precedent and Ethical Considerations:** The acceptance of an AI-generated victim impact statement sets a legal precedent with uncertain consequences. It raises ethical questions about the extent to which AI can represent human emotion and intent, especially from deceased individuals. There is a risk that this could open the door for the exploitation of victims or the manipulation of legal proceedings.

**Cultural Impact on Justice and Forgiveness:** This event sparks a conversation about how AI may reshape societal norms regarding justice and forgiveness. The use of an AI avatar to convey forgiveness challenges traditional notions of closure and reconciliation, potentially altering how individuals process grief and seek justice. The introduction of AI into such sensitive contexts may also desensitize individuals to the emotional weight of these proceedings.

#### Potential Insights for AI Research

This article highlights potential applications of generative AI, specifically concerning AI expression of emotion. This intersects with evaluation of AI systems, particularly how to measure the appropriateness and impact of AI-generated content in sensitive contexts such as legal proceedings. Determining if an AI-generated expression of forgiveness has the same effect as a human one falls under the umbrella of capability assessment, which your research touches on. Furthermore, this is an example of an end-user application for agentic systems and poses important questions about how these systems should be deployed, and what could go wrong.

## ‘MAGA is a big lesson to us’: Suntory’s Niinami on tariffs, Japanese dealmakers, and inclusive capitalism

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/d1b8ce61ab8cff221770a1f9816cf2766dfa8346-3547x2660.jpg?rect=0,399,3547,1862&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
Takeshi "Tak" Niinami, CEO of Suntory, reflects on the lessons learned from the MAGA movement and its implications for businesses globally. He argues that the rise of populism, exemplified by Donald Trump's presidency, stems from societal "anger, mistrust, and anxiety" arising from old-fashioned capitalism that hasn't benefited everyone. Niinami urges corporate leaders to embrace "inclusive" capitalism, redistributing wealth and compensating those negatively impacted by globalization. He criticizes Big Tech executives for benefiting from globalization without adequately addressing its adverse effects on ordinary workers.

Niinami also discusses the impact of Trump's trade policies on consumer behavior, noting a "trade-down" effect where consumers opt for cheaper alternatives due to tariff-induced anxieties. He shares Suntory's experience of navigating these challenges by stockpiling products and managing price pressures. Reflecting on Suntory's acquisition of Beam, Niinami emphasizes the importance of cultural integration and strong leadership from the acquiring company to avoid common pitfalls in Japanese-US business deals. He highlights the need for Japanese companies to be less "naive" and more assertive in managing their US subsidiaries.

Looking ahead, Niinami sees a turning point for corporate Japan, with companies holding significant excess cash. He encourages them to invest in new frontiers and acquisitions rather than focusing solely on stock repurchases or dividends. He also expresses concerns about geopolitical risks, including China's actions in the Taiwan Strait and the potential dangers of unregulated AI. Niinami stresses the importance of corporate sustainability efforts in building trust with societies and calls for coordination in sustainability and AI regulation, especially in the absence of strong international leadership. Ultimately, he believes that businesses must earn society's support to thrive in an increasingly turbulent world.

#### Why does this matter?
**Inclusive Capitalism and Wealth Redistribution:** Niinami's call for corporations to redistribute wealth to those negatively impacted by globalization resonates with broader discussions on ethical AI and societal impact. As AI-driven automation potentially exacerbates economic disparities, his perspective prompts reflection on the responsibilities of companies developing and deploying these technologies to mitigate potential negative consequences and ensure equitable distribution of benefits.

**Geopolitical Risks and Global Coordination:** Niinami's concerns about geopolitical risks, particularly regarding China and unregulated AI, highlight the importance of international cooperation and ethical considerations in technology development. The potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, including the risk of autonomous weapons systems, underscores the need for global governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to prevent misuse and ensure responsible innovation.

## Trump, Putin discuss ways to end war in Ukraine in 2-hour phone call

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/23d3721235ce74e428e617b7bddcd7bd8f0c4635-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

The article reports that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Putin characterized the call as "meaningful, frank, and very useful," indicating Russia's willingness to work with Ukraine on a potential peace treaty and ceasefire. Trump stated the call went "very well," and suggested that Kyiv and Moscow would "immediately" begin peace negotiations. Despite this reported diplomatic activity, Ukraine reported Russia launched its largest drone attack since the war began.

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Implications:** The direct communication between Trump and Putin regarding the war in Ukraine has significant implications for international relations and the future of the conflict. If the claims are true that peace talks will "immediately" begin, this could signal a potential shift in diplomatic strategy and potentially alter the trajectory of the war. However, the drone strike suggests otherwise, and that regardless of diplomatic talks the war will continue.

**Potential for Misinformation:** Trump's claim that negotiations will "immediately" begin should be monitored for its accuracy and potential to influence public opinion. Claims made during and after the phone call should be vetted for misinformation.

## Concerns mount over US debt, inflation risks

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/9bc4940f539d6a0fb170170942100473b899c87b-4515x3010.jpg?rect=0,320,4515,2370&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

### Summary

The article from Semafor reports growing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy, with U.S. stocks expected to fall and Treasury yields rising. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, stated that "the risks for US government debt are greater than the rating agencies are conveying." Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, warned that markets were "underpricing geopolitical and inflation risks". This follows last week’s downgrade of US Treasurys by Moody’s.

### Why does this matter?

**Economic Instability:** The warnings from major figures like Dalio and Dimon, coupled with the Moody's downgrade, suggest a potentially unstable economic future. The market's apparent underestimation of geopolitical and inflation risks could lead to unexpected shocks and volatility.

**Impact on Investment:** Increased risk in the US economy could impact the availability of funding for speculative technologies like AI. Further, economic instability can lead to a reprioritization of governmental and private spending, possibly away from long-term research.

## G7 finance leaders meet amid trade tensions

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/28d713128efadab063aa8064a4127065af3fccec-4260x2840.jpg?rect=0,302,4260,2237&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

G7 finance ministers are meeting in Canada amidst trade tensions and uncertainty over US tariffs. The Western alliance aims to present a united front on issues like the Ukraine war, China’s industrial capacity, and climate change. However, analysts anticipate that any consensus will likely align with US President Donald Trump’s priorities, making trade deals with Washington unlikely. As a result, the joint communiqué is expected to be vague, with ING warning that any deviation from previous foreign-exchange policy agreements could significantly impact the dollar's value. Ahead of the talks, the euro rose to a 10-day high.

#### Why does this matter?

This article describes that international trade and foreign exchange policy are at odds, and agreement is unlikely given the current political climate. The stability of the dollar is a primary concern. The communique of the G7 finance leaders is anticipated to be vague because of conflicting priorities, which implies a lack of concrete action on critical global issues.

## Japan's exports to US fall as tariffs bite

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/9928dcf1b7af499cf690ebf3d2541993c058c78e-5500x3649.jpg?rect=0,381,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Japan's exports to the US experienced a decline in April, marking the first decrease this year, attributed to the impact of Washington's tariffs and a slowdown in trade negotiations. As a key US trading partner, Japan is particularly susceptible to President Trump's auto tariffs, yet both countries have not achieved a breakthrough in negotiations. Tokyo insists on the removal of tariffs, a position emphasized by its chief negotiator recently, fearing that making concessions would harm them electorally. Despite the stalemate, Japan's position as the largest foreign holder of US debt provides leverage, suggesting that an agreement is likely to be reached eventually, given the importance of the relationship for both nations ("since it is too important for either side to have it end in failure" - Foreign Policy).

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Implications**: The article highlights the potential risks of the current trade impasse between the US and Japan. The article also suggests that Japan's position as a major holder of US debt can be a negotiating tool.

**International Relations**: The stalemate in trade talks between the US and Japan demonstrates the complexities of international relations, where domestic political considerations ("making concessions would hurt them electorally") can significantly influence trade policies and negotiations. Understanding these dynamics can provide insights into the challenges of fostering international cooperation and addressing global issues.

## Kyiv’s allies threaten further sanctions on Moscow ahead of Ukraine-Russia talks

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/ccb2c99401069022863b4660a6327f5a0d4d5eba-3183x2054.jpg?rect=0,192,3183,1671&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Western allies of Kyiv have threatened Russia with further sanctions if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire in upcoming talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine in Turkey. European foreign ministers joined Ukraine in calling on the Kremlin to agree to a ceasefire or risk additional restrictions. US Special Envoy Keith Kellogg also warned that Washington could levy new sanctions if the Kremlin does not agree to a truce with Ukraine: "Kellogg is expected to attend Thursday’s talks". Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will be in Turkey and was prepared to meet directly with Vladimir Putin, but Russia is expected to send other officials.

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical and Economic Ramifications:** The threat of further sanctions highlights the ongoing economic pressure on Russia, which may influence its negotiating position and overall actions in the conflict. The success or failure of these talks and the imposition of further sanctions could have significant consequences for the global economy and international relations.

**Future Policy Impact:** The article highlights the potential for new sanctions based on Russia's actions, which could inform future policy decisions regarding international conflict resolution and economic statecraft. The stated positions of key figures like Keith Kellogg and Volodymyr Zelenskyy provide insights into the diplomatic strategies being employed.

## Sanders adviser Stephanie Kelton praises Trump's tax hike suggestion

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/fb5f9abeeb70f550f2f08ce2e9608b2dc4f5e8cf-1191x893.jpg?rect=0,135,1191,625&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The article reports on Stephanie Kelton, an economic advisor to Bernie Sanders, supporting President Trump's suggestion to let tax cuts expire for higher earners. Kelton argues that targeting the $1 million to $2.5 million income bracket with a 39.6% tax rate is "directionally correct" and "the right idea for mitigating the inflation risk." She believes that cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and overtime would be "likely to be stimulative" and increase the potential for inflation, so offsetting these cuts with targeted tax increases on higher earners would be prudent.

Kelton, known for her advocacy of Modern Monetary Theory, suggests that the top 10% of Americans account for a large proportion of consumer spending. Therefore, managing their consumption through taxes is a way to manage inflation. Trump's willingness to consider higher taxes on the rich aligns with his "working-class Republican Party" rhetoric, although this position deviates from traditional Republican tax policy. Steve Bannon noted that this shift shows "how much we changed the electorate and how little we’ve changed the party." Newt Gingrich, however, opposes any Republican shift toward higher taxes, warning of Republican in-fighting that the media would love to watch.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights a potential realignment in economic policy, where figures from opposite ends of the political spectrum find common ground. It also shows the complexities of economic policy, where seemingly simple decisions can have cascading effects on inflation, consumer spending, and political alliances. This potential alliance between factions within the Democratic and Republican parties could result in major changes in the future.

## Cuts at NOAA lead to new weather balloon technology at the agency

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/3be0283bab024510babdee8313746966772da5a8-2880x2160.jpg?rect=0,324,2880,1512&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

A Silicon Valley startup, WindBorne, will begin replacing NOAA's weather balloons with AI-powered alternatives due to budget cuts enacted by the Trump administration at the recommendation of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These cuts forced staff reductions and program shutdowns within NOAA. WindBorne's balloons, which can stay aloft for weeks using AI to control elevation and navigate wind currents, offer a potentially cost-effective solution for gathering weather data compared to traditional single-day balloons.

WindBorne already provides data to NOAA, but the agency had previously been hesitant to expand the partnership. The company uses satellite connectivity and tiny motors to control ballast, enabling the AI to steer the balloons to specific locations for data collection. WindBorne aims to have 10,000 balloons in the air, providing global coverage. Currently, the data from its 50-60 balloons is purchased by traders for commodity price forecasting.

John Dean, WindBorne's CEO, stated that NOAA has shifted from a hands-off approach to one that is eager for partnerships. He believes the budget cuts, while "reckless," may ultimately lead to more data collection. Former National Weather Service chief Louis Uccellini told PBS News that NOAA cuts could be disastrous for public safety, particularly as the country faces severe weather threats. However, one area where NOAA has aggressively cut is climate research.

#### Why does this matter?

**Efficiency and Innovation:** The shift from traditional weather balloons to AI-powered alternatives highlights the potential for private sector innovation to improve government operations and reduce costs. Musk's thesis that technology can improve efficiency may be justified.

**Data Quality and Availability:** While budget cuts may initially seem detrimental, the move towards WindBorne's technology could lead to a greater volume of weather data. This could improve the accuracy and scope of weather forecasting models, benefiting various sectors from emergency services to commodity trading.

**Political and Economic Impacts:** The article raises questions about the role of political agendas in shaping government policies, specifically concerning climate research. It also touches on the economic implications of government contracting practices and the potential for direct engagement with innovative startups.

## Russia and Ukraine agree to prisoner swap in first direct talks since 2022

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/0b5e4e6ad62b8d7bf9133410b38c7baf0e3ceb8a-8640x5760.jpg?rect=0,612,8640,4536&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
Russia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, resulting in a significant prisoner swap involving 1000 prisoners of war from each side. While both countries remain divided on terms to end the conflict, particularly regarding territorial control, they've agreed to continue negotiations and document their visions for a ceasefire deal. According to Russia's top negotiator, the Kremlin is "ready to continue contacts." Russia expert Samuel Charap considered the agreement to continue negotiations "better than expected," noting that expecting concrete results from the initial meeting would have been "shocking."

#### Why does this matter?
**Geopolitical Implications:** The resumption of direct talks, even without immediate breakthroughs, signifies a potential shift in diplomatic engagement. The agreement to continue negotiations and document ceasefire visions could lay the groundwork for future de-escalation efforts, however distant they may seem currently.

**Economic Repercussions:** The ongoing conflict and the potential for resolution directly affect global markets, resource availability, and economic stability. Any progress toward a ceasefire could lead to shifts in investment strategies and trade relations, while continued deadlock would prolong economic uncertainties.

## Tech companies are hiring fewer early career workers, report says

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/49fb950e1cb30b61b6bf50c84674783e0f50bde9-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

A recent report by SignalFire indicates a significant decrease in the hiring of early career workers by Big Tech and startups. These companies are hiring roughly half as many early career workers as a percentage of their total new hires compared to pre-pandemic levels. The report suggests that companies are increasingly filling lower-level positions with more experienced individuals. The year 2023 saw a brief surge in starting positions due to layoffs in senior roles, but this trend did not persist. The rise of AI tools capable of automating tasks traditionally performed by junior employees is expected to further exacerbate this situation. As the article says, "companies are posting lower-level roles and hiring more experienced [individuals] to fill them." This creates a Catch-22 situation for young people seeking to gain experience in the tech industry.

#### Why This Matters

**Industry Hiring Trends:** The shift towards hiring more experienced individuals for lower-level roles in tech could reflect a greater need for immediate productivity and expertise, rather than investing in training early career employees. This trend could have implications for the talent pipeline and the long-term availability of skilled workers in the tech industry.

**Impact of AI on Entry-Level Roles:** The increasing automation of tasks traditionally performed by junior employees may accelerate the decline in entry-level positions. This shift highlights the need to understand the extent to which AI tools are displacing early career workers, and the implications for workforce development and education.

**Catch-22 for Young Professionals:** The difficulty for young professionals to gain experience due to companies prioritizing experienced hires presents a significant challenge. This Catch-22 calls for strategies to bridge the experience gap, such as internships, apprenticeships, or alternative pathways to entry-level positions.

## International pressure mounts on Moscow to end Ukraine war

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/db8ccb3ac7eb5291e7687865ab7a6da03af16364-5256x3504.jpg?rect=0,373,5256,2759&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
International pressure is building on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged new sanctions targeting those purchasing Russian oil and financial services. This sentiment is supported by the new German chancellor. Even former Kremlin sympathizer, US President Donald Trump, is reportedly growing impatient with Moscow's "intransigence" (Financial Times). One of Trump's allies has proposed a 500% tariff on countries that continue to buy Russian fuel, a plan that has surprisingly garnered bipartisan support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to travel to Turkey for peace talks, with the intention of demonstrating to Trump that Vladimir Putin is the primary obstacle to achieving peace, as Putin has not yet committed to participating in these talks.

#### Why Does This Matter?
**Geopolitical Shifts:** The shift in Trump's stance toward Russia, coupled with bipartisan support for tariffs, signals a potential change in US foreign policy that could impact global alliances and trade relationships.
**Economic Consequences:** The proposed sanctions and tariffs could significantly affect the Russian economy and global energy markets, potentially leading to inflation and supply chain disruptions.
**Diplomatic Efforts:** Zelenskyy's efforts to engage in peace talks and demonstrate Putin's unwillingness to compromise highlight the importance of diplomacy and international mediation in resolving the conflict.

## US approves first Alzheimer’s blood test

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/99c0e6c7ee37e75c007ef504a72e3a1d9b77f435-6601x4401.jpg?rect=0,468,6601,3466&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The FDA has approved the first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The test, developed by a Japanese biotech company, identifies proteins in the blood that suggest the presence of amyloid plaques, a key indicator of Alzheimer's. While the test cannot definitively diagnose the disease or provide a cure, experts believe it can be a valuable screening tool for adults aged 55 and older who are at risk, potentially accelerating diagnosis and treatment before severe symptoms like memory loss appear.

#### Why does this matter?
This development signifies a move towards less invasive and more accessible diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's. The approval of a blood test could dramatically change the landscape of early detection and intervention, shifting from costly and complex procedures to more routine screenings. This advancement may also spur further research and development in the field of neurodegenerative disease diagnostics and treatments.

## UK inflation jumps unexpectedly in April

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/541fbb9289eef7cb845ac0d1b7795e666dbecab5-6938x5464.jpg?rect=0,911,6938,3642&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

The UK's inflation rate unexpectedly jumped to 3.5% in April, exceeding the Bank of England's target level by 1.5 percentage points. The largest drivers were increased household bill costs (water and energy), higher food prices, and a minimum wage increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment in the figures. The Bank of England's chief economist suggested that interest rates may have been cut "too rapidly" since mid-2024. The economist also said long-term shifts in business pricing strategies and employee wage negotiations could sustain "inflation higher for longer" (The Guardian).

In related news, US inflation rose less than expected in April despite the implementation of President Trump’s tariffs. The consumer price index increased by 0.2% for the month, with the 12-month inflation rate at 2.3%. According to Morgan Stanley's top US economist, there is typically a "lag time before [tariff hikes] change prices" (The Wall Street Journal). *The New York Times* noted that many businesses have imported goods ahead of the tariffs to avoid higher costs.

#### Why does this matter?

*   **Economic Forecasting Challenges:** The unexpected surge in UK inflation, despite efforts to manage it, emphasizes the complexities and potential inaccuracies in current economic forecasting models. External factors (such as tariffs) can cause unforeseen behavior in economic systems, which may call for new forecasting systems.
*   **Lagged Effects of Policy:** The US inflation report, coupled with the economist's warning about lag time, highlights the delayed impact of policy decisions such as tariff implementations. These delays might require more sophisticated modeling to accurately predict outcomes and avoid unintended economic consequences.
*   **Impact of Minimum Wage:** The article mentions a minimum wage increase as a contributing factor to inflation, which might be worth researching as it could be a possible negative side effect of the policy.
