## CPAC chair plans more conservative gatherings around the world

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2925x1645+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2F9d%2F758feb704c70bb16207032eeec8c%2F20250528-dsc07696-edit.jpg" width="500px">

#### Summary
CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp spoke with NPR in Budapest about expanding the organization's reach globally. He mentioned upcoming CPAC events in Australia, Japan, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. According to Schlapp, international leaders are looking to the U.S. and President Trump for direction. He stated, "The one thing that's undeniable is that everybody wants to know where Donald Trump is on the issues that matter to their country... They're really rooting for Donald Trump to succeed."

Schlapp believes that "populist conservative victories" are on the rise because people view large global institutions as "the autocrats, not the saviors of the little guy." He also praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's policies, particularly those related to immigration, stating, "What's happening in Europe is the EU wants to dictate to these countries how many migrants they take and what Orbán and the people of Hungary are saying is, no, we're going to determine what our immigration policy is." When asked about policies he'd like to bring back to the U.S. from Hungary, Schlapp pointed to Orbán's focus on increasing the population by supporting families and reducing abortions through tax policies that provide financial security for raising children.

#### Why this matters
**Global Political Trends:** The expansion of CPAC and the embrace of Trumpism by international leaders suggests a potential shift in global political ideologies. Schlapp notes that many view center-right parties as having failed them and that new parties are sprouting up as a result.

**Challenges to Global Institutions:** Schlapp's comments about global institutions being perceived as "autocrats" reflect a growing sentiment of distrust in international bodies like the EU, UN, and WHO. This could have implications for international cooperation and policy-making, particularly in areas like immigration and healthcare.

**Multicultural Implications:** The discussion of immigration policies and population growth strategies in Hungary highlights the diverse approaches countries are taking to address these issues. Schlapp's interest in replicating Hungary's policies in the U.S. raises questions about the adaptability and cultural relevance of such policies in different contexts.

## Fu Zai, China's first police corgi, racks up followers on social media

<img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide-s1400-c100.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Science*

#### Summary
Fu Zai, a corgi with a local police department in China, is being promoted as the country's first police corgi and has gained over 400,000 social media followers. According to his police trainer, Zhao Qingshuai, Fu Zai's short legs make him well-suited for sniffing out explosives in hard-to-reach places such as under vehicles or train seats. Qingshuai also noted Fu Zai's "remarkable interaction skills." However, Lance Nogosek, a former military dog trainer, argues that corgis' small size is a disadvantage, stating that larger dogs like German Shepherds and bloodhounds have more olfactory sensors, making them more capable.

#### Why this matters
**Cross-cultural comparison:** This article highlights a novel application of a dog breed in a specific cultural context (China) and compares it to Western perspectives on working dog breeds. This article mentions how he's "billed as China's very first police corgi". The success of Fu Zai as a social media influencer is also notable, indicating a potential shift in public perception and acceptance of different dog breeds in law enforcement in China.
**Non-traditional application of a breed:** The article presents a unique and potentially unconventional use of corgis as police dogs, contrasting with the traditional use of larger breeds like German Shepherds. The trainer, Zhao Qingshuai, argues that the corgi's short legs are advantageous for specific tasks. However, the counterargument from Lance Nogosek about olfactory capabilities highlights the debate around breed selection for specific roles.

## Raising ethics questions, top Trump meme coin investors to dine with president tonight

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F26%2Fa1e7c1454e1fa4ce16cfbe97ac53%2Fgettyimages-2212249694.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Technology*

President Trump is hosting a dinner for 220 of the largest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin at his golf club near Washington, D.C. The coin's value surged after its launch but has since experienced volatility. The event raises ethical concerns due to the potential for conflicts of interest and violations of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign governments. Ethics experts like Norm Eisen, a former ethics advisor to President Obama, view this as "the most profound ethics and constitutional emoluments violations in the history of our presidency."

Attendees include crypto-investor Justin Sun, founder of TRON, who announced on X that he is the top holder of $TRUMP and will attend the dinner. Sun was previously charged by the SEC for unregistered sale of cryptocurrencies and artificially inflating trading volume. Other attendees include MemeCore, a Singapore-based crypto network, and reportedly Wintermute, a London-based crypto market-making firm. White House officials maintain that the meme coin has "nothing to do with the White House." Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Trump supporter, stated that the situation "gives me pause," and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said "I don't think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour."

### Why This Matters

**Ethical Considerations in AI and Politics:** The intersection of cryptocurrency investments and political access highlights potential ethical dilemmas. It raises questions about influence, transparency, and the potential for conflicts of interest when political figures are associated with speculative digital assets.

**Impact on Public Perception:** The article highlights the highly speculative nature of meme coins, with one expert noting, "Meme coins aren't investments. I wouldn't even call them speculative. They're riskier than the dog track," and "This isn't even casino-level risk...In a casino, at least there's odds." This scenario also has implications for public trust and perception of leaders using novelties such as meme coins as political fundraisers. This may affect public trust in AI technologies as well.

## Trump’s Campaign to Scare Off Foreign Students

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/LIanPk4o9HKXlwdPFDk3NFeW1JQ=/0x61:2876x1559/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/05/2025_05_foreign_students_1/original.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: The Atlantic*

#### Summary

The article in *The Atlantic* discusses the Trump administration's policies that are deterring foreign students from enrolling in American universities. These policies include delaying student visa interviews, revoking existing visas for minor infractions or perceived political disagreements, and demanding detailed information from universities about international students. The administration justifies these measures by linking foreign students to pro-Palestinian protests and harassment of Jewish students on campuses. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that visas would be denied to students "doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus.” Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of inviting foreign students who "engage in violent behavior and show contempt for the United States of America, to its campus.”

These actions have led to thousands of students losing their legal status and facing legal challenges, with a judge even blocking the revocation of Harvard's ability to host international students. Harvard is now allowing international students to accept offers from overseas universities as a backup. Experts like Kevin Carey from New America warn that cutting off foreign students will lead them to go elsewhere, harming the U.S. economy and innovation, as international students contributed almost $44 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023-24 and founded about a quarter of billion-dollar start-ups in America. Despite Trump's previous endorsement of granting green cards to graduating foreign students, his administration now aims to reduce their presence in the U.S., aligning with an "America First" ethos. Vice President J.D. Vance believes international students are "bad for the American dream for a lot of kids who want to go to a nice university and can’t because their spot was taken by a foreign student.”

#### Why this matters

**Economic Impact:** The potential reduction in international students could significantly impact the U.S. economy, particularly the higher education sector, given their substantial financial contributions and the jobs they support.

**University Autonomy and free expression:** The administration's demands for detailed information on international students' activities and disciplinary records could infringe on university autonomy and potentially stifle free expression among students. The article mentions that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declared that Harvard had refused to adequately answer questions about its international students “while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies.”

**Global Talent Competition:** Restricting opportunities for international students may push talented individuals to pursue education and careers in other countries, diminishing America's competitive edge in innovation and technology.

## Trump’s Embrace of Putin Shows Few Results

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/QpVtPugrlJIO80_RWYuzbCrQN6E=/3x61:2699x1465/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/05/2025_05_27_daily_putin/original.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: The New York Times*

#### Summary
The articles from *The Atlantic* and *NPR* discuss President Trump's recent expressions of frustration with Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine. Trump has used his Truth Social platform to criticize Putin's actions, even suggesting that Putin has "gone absolutely crazy" (*The Atlantic*) and warning of potential sanctions (*NPR*). He has also claimed that Russia would have faced "really bad things" if not for him and accused Putin of "playing with fire" (*NPR*). However, Trump also indicated he doesn't want to "screw up" a potential deal by imposing sanctions prematurely (*NPR*).

The Kremlin's response has been measured, with officials downplaying Trump's statements and emphasizing the complexity of negotiations (*NPR*). Putin himself has remained silent, while his spokesman Dmitry Peskov has complimented Trump's efforts to end the conflict (*NPR*). Russia has also announced its readiness to hold another round of peace talks in Istanbul (*NPR*). However, *The Atlantic* notes that Trump apparently still believes he has a personal connection to Putin and can influence him, despite evidence to the contrary. The article also points out that Putin's behavior is becoming a liability for Trump, who had previously claimed he could quickly end the war.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Western weapons can be used in Ukraine without range limits, a move denounced by Russia as "dangerous" (*The Atlantic*). Trump's administration is portrayed as somewhat dysfunctional, with *The Atlantic* highlighting the inexperience and pro-Russian sympathies of some of his key advisors. Trump's attempts to evade blame for the situation are also noted, with him adding Putin to the list of those responsible for the war (*The Atlantic*).

#### Why does this matter?
This situation highlights the complexities of international relations and the challenges of evaluating the motivations and intentions of key actors like Putin and Trump. The analysis presented shows the difficulty in assessing the true impact of public statements and diplomatic efforts on the ground. The discussion of Western weapons and their range limitations touches on ethical considerations in warfare. The question of whether Trump is truly seeking peace or simply trying to evade blame for his failure to end the war is left open to interpretation.

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1223301957.jpg?resize=1200,646" width="500px">

*Source: TechCrunch*

#### Summary

Nvidia and AMD are preparing to sell new, compliant GPUs in China to adhere to U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology, according to DigiTimes. Nvidia plans to offer a "stripped-down AI GPU" called "B20," while AMD will target AI workloads with its Radeon AI PRO R9700 workstation GPU. These chips are expected to be available starting in July. Reuters reported that Nvidia is developing a budget AI chip based on its Blackwell architecture for the Chinese market, priced between $6,500 and $8,000, compared to the H20 GPUs which sell for $10,000 to $12,000. Nvidia reported a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to licensing requirements affecting H20 sales in China, and an additional $2.5 billion in H20 shipments were impacted, with an $8 billion revenue hit expected in Q2. Separately, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has criticized U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors to China, stating they have "backfired" by encouraging Chinese companies like Huawei to innovate faster. Huang said that Chinese companies were given "the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development" and that "the export control was a failure."

#### Why does this matter?

**Impact of Export Controls:** The article highlights the consequences of U.S. export controls on the semiconductor industry and their potential unintended effects. Nvidia's financial losses and the claim that Chinese firms are accelerating their development demonstrate the complexities of regulating technology exports.

**Geopolitical Implications:** The tension between the U.S. and China in the semiconductor industry has implications for technology leadership, economic competitiveness, and global supply chains. Huang engaging in "chip diplomacy" in the Middle East and Asia further underscores these geopolitical dynamics.

**Innovation Incentives:** The statement from Huang that export controls are causing Chinese firms to innovate more rapidly is an insight regarding how benchmarks and state of the art is determined, and what incentives exist. Furthermore, any future work assessing the validity of claims about technology leadership needs to take into consideration the economic environment of these technologies.

## The sweeping federal court order blocking Trump’s tariffs, explained

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/gettyimages-2216570945.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.706819365187%2C100%2C78.586361269627&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
A federal court has ruled President Trump's tariffs illegal, arguing they exceed constitutional limits on Congress's power to delegate tariff authority to the president. The court's decision in *V.O.S. Selections v. United States* and *Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security* cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 as imposing constraints Trump surpassed. The court found the tariffs don't effectively address the stated threat of drug trafficking and are thus illegal. The ruling also includes a nationwide injunction against the tariffs.

The White House has appealed the decision. Financial markets reacted positively to the news of the ruling, with U.S. futures and oil prices rising, and the dollar strengthening against the yen and euro (NPR). Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.9%. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management commented that the ruling was, at the least, "a brief respite before the next thunderclap" (NPR).

#### Potential Economic Impact
The court's decision, if upheld, could significantly alter the landscape of international trade and the president's ability to unilaterally impose tariffs. The NPR article indicates that financial markets have responded favorably to the ruling, suggesting a perception that reduced trade tensions could boost economic stability. The article also mentions that uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs has "stymied businesses and left consumers wary about what lies ahead," implying that the ruling could alleviate some of this economic anxiety (NPR).

#### International Relations
The NPR article notes that Japan, a key U.S. ally in Asia, has been urging Trump to cancel tariffs on imports from Japan, including those on steel, aluminum, and autos. The court's ruling and the potential rollback of tariffs could ease tensions with trade partners and shift international trade dynamics. The article also notes the Bank of Korea's decision to cut its key interest rate "to ease pressure on the economy," suggesting that the ruling may influence economic policy decisions in other countries (NPR).

#### Relevance to AI and Technology
The NPR article mentions Nvidia's strong performance, attributing it to "feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human." The article also mentions Nvidia overcoming "tariff-driven turbulence," indicating that tariffs may be a factor which shapes the AI industry's performance.

## Trump figured out how to hit Harvard where it really hurts

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/gettyimages-2217246201.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
The article discusses the Trump administration's decision to bar international students from attending Harvard University, characterizing it as an "act of war" against higher education rather than a simple policy change. While the action was stayed by a federal judge, the article argues that the damage is already being done as potential students may be deterred by the possibility of deportation or imprisonment. The author, Kevin Carey, highlights the significant role international students, particularly those from China, have played in bolstering American universities financially, diversifying academic communities, and driving research and innovation.

The article traces the history of international student enrollment, noting the surge in Chinese students following China's economic liberalization and the subsequent reliance of American universities on full-pay international students to offset financial challenges. It also acknowledges potential drawbacks, such as universities struggling to manage the influx of students from specific countries, and instances of fraud among international student recruiters. The article concludes by warning that expanding the visa restrictions beyond Harvard could lead to a "catastrophe for American leadership in science and technology" as other countries move to attract talent away from the US. The article references JD Vance's call to "aggressively attack the universities," framing the Trump administration's actions as part of a broader culture war aimed at institutions perceived as training grounds for the opposition.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights the potential consequences of protectionist policies on the international flow of talent and the funding of higher education. It emphasizes the reliance of American universities on international students, particularly from China, and how restrictions on student visas could negatively impact both the institutions themselves and American innovation more broadly. The article also touches on the cultural and political dimensions of the issue, framing the attacks on universities as part of a broader culture war.

## Google as you know it is slowly dying

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Google-AI.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C13.641652123328%2C100%2C72.716695753345&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
The article discusses the potential decline of Google Search as it is known today, driven by the rise of AI-powered search tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. The author, Adam Clark Estes from Vox, describes Google's response to this challenge, including the introduction of "AI Overviews" and "AI Mode," which leverage Google's large language model, Gemini, to provide summarized search results and a chatbot-based search experience. While Estes admits to liking the new AI-driven Google, he acknowledges the unreliability of large language models and the potential for hallucinations. The article also touches on the impact of AI on publishers, who are experiencing declines in traffic from Google as users bypass traditional search results in favor of AI chatbots. The author notes that "AI everything is where we’re headed," with Google rolling out Gemini in Chrome to analyze websites and YouTube videos in real time.
The article quotes industry experts such as Casey Newton from Platformer, who said, "everything is changing and normal and scary and chill," and Ben Thompson, who declared "the death of the ad-supported web," thanks to Google. John Herrman from New York magazine stated more bluntly: "Google is burying the web alive."

#### Why does this matter?
The article outlines the shift in how users access and process information, potentially impacting the design and evaluation of AI systems. It also discusses the effect of AI-driven search on content creators and publishers, raising important questions about traffic, quality, and monetization in the age of AI.

*   **Evolving Search Paradigms:** The transition from keyword-based search to AI-powered summaries and chatbots reflects a change in user expectations and interaction models.
*   **Generative AI Reliability:** The article highlights the potential for large language models to produce unreliable or inaccurate information, which is a key area of concern.
*   **Economic Impact on Content Creation:** The decrease in traffic to publishers due to AI-driven search raises concerns about the sustainability of content creation.

## US government sanctions tech company involved in cyber scams

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-polyfill-macau-skyline.jpg?w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: TechCrunch*

#### Summary
The U.S. government has sanctioned FUNNULL, a Philippines-based company run by Chinese national Liu Lizhi, for providing infrastructure to cybercriminals involved in "pig butchering" crypto scams. These scams, which involve building relationships with victims online and then tricking them into investing in fake crypto projects, have cost American victims $200 million, with an average loss of $150,000 per victim. FUNNULL allegedly provided domain names, IP addresses, and web design templates to these cybercriminals, making it easier for them to impersonate trusted brands and quickly change their online presence to evade detection. The Treasury also highlighted FUNNULL's involvement in the Polyfill supply chain attack, where they altered code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam and online gambling sites. Zach Edwards, a researcher at Silent Push, stated that he was “really glad to see the facts aligned with our suspicions,” and called the sanctions “an important first step.”

#### Why does this matter?
**Cybersecurity Landscape:** This event underscores the growing threat of cyber scams and the increasing sophistication of the infrastructure supporting them. The fact that a company like FUNNULL could provide services that enable widespread fraud highlights the vulnerabilities in the current cybersecurity landscape.
**International Implications:** The involvement of a company based in the Philippines and run by a Chinese national highlights the global nature of cybercrime and the challenges in combating it. Edwards stated, “This effort from FUNNULL is the tip of the iceberg for what is actually going on right now out of China with financial schemes targeting Americans.” This suggests that international cooperation and vigilance are essential to addressing this issue effectively.
**Supply Chain Security:** The reference to the Polyfill supply chain attack emphasizes the potential for malicious actors to compromise legitimate software supply chains and use them to distribute malware or redirect users to malicious sites. This underscores the importance of robust security measures throughout the software development and distribution process.

## A decade in, bootstrapped Thinkst Canary reaches $20M in ARR without VC funding

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/canary-tools-getty-1732944703.jpg?resize=1200,1173" width="500px">

*Source: TechCrunch*

### Summary

Thinkst Canary, a cybersecurity company specializing in honeypot technology, is celebrating its 10th anniversary. The company has reached $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) without taking any outside funding. Founder and CEO Haroon Meer attributes this success to focusing on customer needs and delivering a reliable product, rather than prioritizing rapid growth at all costs. Key to their offering is the "Canary," a hardware device that acts as an early warning system by detecting and alerting when hackers access a company's network, posing as a vulnerable target to lure attackers. Thinkst also offers "Canary Tokens," which are free, publicly available traps that alert users when someone accesses seemingly valuable items like passwords or credit card numbers placed in secure locations. Meer emphasizes the effectiveness of the Canary system, noting that its simplicity makes it difficult to deploy incorrectly. According to Meer, customer success stories and word-of-mouth marketing are the primary drivers of the company's organic sales growth, with a focus on providing a good product at a fair price.

### Why This Matters

**Industry Alternative:** This article highlights a successful cybersecurity company that has deliberately avoided the venture capital model, achieving significant revenue through organic growth and customer satisfaction. This offers an alternative model to the typical "growth-at-all-costs" approach often seen in the tech industry, and emphasizes that VC funding is "not the gate that stops you from doing stuff."

**Efficacy of Deception:** The success of Thinkst Canary underscores the value of deception and honeypots as a cybersecurity strategy. The article states that "It’s rare for us to have a week without getting an email from a customer saying this saved our lives, or we had a pen test and this is the only thing that caught our attackers." The simplicity and effectiveness of the Canary system in detecting malicious activity, as emphasized by Meer ("If you make it fit in, then you catch attackers, and if you make it stick out, you catch attackers"), could also offer insight into agent deception methods, since human attackers may take an agentic system at face value and assume certain vulnerabilities and logic errors when they are actually being trapped.

**Customer-Centric Growth:** Thinkst's focus on customer needs and delivering a reliable product has resulted in high customer retention and organic growth. This reinforces the importance of prioritizing product quality and customer satisfaction over aggressive expansion, even in a rapidly evolving field like cybersecurity. Meer points to 60% of their first-year customers still remaining with the company as a success metric that demonstrates how their customer focus is working.

## AI-powered fanfiction blurs political reality

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/84a1f466871d1283203b327a9419a690ac2dfe98-1652x1239.png?rect=0,187,1652,867&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

The article from Semafor discusses the rise of AI-generated fanfiction featuring real politicians on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. These fabricated stories often depict dramatic and partisan scenarios, sometimes garnering more views than actual news reporting. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, whose name is frequently used in these videos, notes that "clearly the algorithm loves my name, so people do stuff with my name," and suggests that anything using an AI-generated voice is "probably a lie." Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York, is reintroducing legislation to regulate AI "deepfakes," particularly to protect Black women, who she says are often victimized by this technology.

These fake stories, while not yet causing real political problems, are becoming increasingly irritating and worrying to some members of Congress. While some fakery, like bogus estimates of politicians' net worth, requires debunking, these AI-generated stories tend to portray the subjects positively. For example, one story depicts Pete Hegseth cooking for disabled veterans, countering negative media portrayals. During the previous presidential campaign, Donald Trump's operation shared AI images of him saving pets from immigrants and hurricanes. The White House has even shared AI-generated images, including a fantasy of Gaza after a Trump takeover. The newer content often focuses on conflict, packaged as breaking news from an alternate reality.

Mr. Noah's Stories, a YouTube channel featuring these AI-generated narratives, has gained over 42,000 subscribers and 5.6 million views since its creation in January. The AI fanfiction phenomenon highlights a hunger for political conflict stories, even if they are fabricated. The article also notes that being "faked" has become a sign of fame, as seen with Crockett's emergence as an AI slop star due to her real-life "clapbacks." Matthew Gault at 404 Media has investigated the use of AI-created content crowding out real news, while Jordan Calhoun of Lifehacker has identified a formula for these videos: a controversial figure, a verb suggesting violence or rhetoric, and another media figure.

#### Why this matters

**Emergence of "AI Slop"**: The rise of AI-generated political fanfiction represents a new frontier in online misinformation and disinformation, differing from traditional deepfakes. This content isn't about putting words in politicians' mouths but rather creating entire fictional narratives around them.

**Impact on Public Perception**: The article raises concerns about the potential impact of these AI-generated narratives on public perception and political discourse. Even if the stories are obviously fake, their widespread dissemination could contribute to a distorted view of political reality.

**Algorithmic Amplification**: The fact that these fake stories often outperform real news content in terms of views underscores the power of algorithms in shaping online information consumption. This highlights the need to understand and address the algorithmic biases that may be promoting misinformation.

#### Insights for AI Research

**Evaluation of Generative Models**: The article highlights the challenges in evaluating the "truthfulness" and potential impact of AI-generated content. This could be relevant to research on AI evaluation and model metrology, particularly in developing metrics that can assess the potential for generated content to mislead or misinform.

**Multilingual and Multicultural Considerations**: The phenomenon of AI-generated political fanfiction could have different manifestations and impacts in different cultural and linguistic contexts. This could inform research on multilingual and multicultural generative AI, particularly in understanding how cultural norms and political landscapes shape the creation and consumption of AI-generated content.

**Ethical AI**: The article underscores the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI to generate political content. It raises questions about the responsibility of AI developers and platforms in preventing the spread of misinformation and protecting individuals from reputational harm.

## Temu and Shein are reshaping Africa’s biggest online retailer

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/2388ad174b88c82036e9d3563ae019bd897880c6-5520x3680.jpg?rect=0,391,5520,2898&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The article discusses how Jumia, Africa's largest online retailer, is adapting to competition from Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein. Jumia is increasing the number of China-based merchants on its platform to compete with Temu and Shein's aggressive advertising, deep discounts, and fast delivery promises. Temu and Shein operate on a cross-border model, selling directly to African markets without establishing local operations, which gives them advantages like integrated global supply chains and vast cash reserves. Jumia, with a liquidity position of around $100 million and pressure to become profitable by 2027, is focusing on its unique advantages like familiarity with African users, fast delivery, and payment-on-delivery. However, simply listing Chinese merchants may not be enough for Jumia to compete if it doesn't invest aggressively in advertising or merchant price control, according to Abraham Augustine from Norrsken. Jumia exited South Africa and Tunisia late last year to focus on key markets like Egypt, Kenya, and Nigeria.

#### Why does this matter?
**Global E-commerce Dynamics:** The competition between Jumia, Temu, and Shein highlights the evolving dynamics of e-commerce in Africa, with global platforms challenging local incumbents. This signifies a shift in market share and consumer behavior, driven by factors like pricing, supply chain efficiency, and marketing strategies.
**Localization vs. Globalization:** Jumia's strategy to leverage its understanding of African users and payment preferences against the global reach and resources of Temu and Shein presents a case study in localization versus globalization in emerging markets. The success or failure of Jumia's approach could inform strategies for other local businesses facing similar competition.
**Financial Sustainability:** The article emphasizes the financial pressures on Jumia and its need to achieve profitability by 2027. This underscores the challenges of maintaining competitiveness while managing financial resources in a rapidly evolving market.

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/4ddeda908b8f303fc4d6a4bce4f4acad05be864a-4500x3000.jpg?rect=0,319,4500,2363&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Western powers are increasing their support for Ukraine as both Russian and Ukrainian aerial attacks intensify, diminishing hopes for peace talks. Germany, along with Britain, France, and the US, has lifted range restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine for use against Russia. This decision addresses Ukraine's complaint about being restricted in its response to Moscow. Meanwhile, Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine, which Reuters reported as the largest air attack of the war in terms of weapons fired. President Zelenskyy has urged Washington to condemn Russia, stating that "the silence of America … only encourages Putin" (Semafor). Analysts suggest that Russia will likely increase attacks through the summer, particularly as President Trump seemingly disengages from the war. The Guardian noted that "without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on" (Semafor).

#### Why this matters

**Geopolitical Shifts:** This article highlights a potential shift in US foreign policy under President Trump, moving from a path of rapprochement with Russia to a stance that may involve new sanctions. It also underscores the critical role of Western support in Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian aggression, implying that a decrease in this support could significantly prolong the conflict.

**International Relations:** The removal of range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine by Western powers marks a notable escalation in support and reflects a coordinated effort to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. The article underscores the interconnectedness of global politics and the ripple effects of policy decisions made by major players like the US, Germany, Britain and France.

## Financial lobbying storm brews over possible credit card-crypto bill pairing

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/0f214b942a37e5a6f0b8b08eb49ed29ab70e8da9-5900x3923.jpg?rect=0,413,5900,3098&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary
The Senate is considering a bill to regulate stablecoins, but a proposed amendment regarding credit card swipe fees is creating a political battle that could derail the entire bill. Sen. Roger Marshall is considering whether to push for a vote on his swipe fee amendment, which aims to increase competition and lower prices for consumers, according to retailers. However, banks, credit unions, Visa, and Mastercard argue it would force them to reduce customer rewards.

Sen. Thom Tillis stated he would oppose the stablecoin bill if the swipe fee measure is attached: "I’d go from being a co-sponsor to trying to figure out how to tank the [stablecoin] bill." The crypto industry is lobbying against the amendment, while some believe its attachment could attract more Democratic support. Sen. Durbin, who opposes the stablecoin bill, acknowledged the difficult position the amendment puts him in.

Senate leadership anticipates votes on stablecoin amendments, but it's uncertain if Marshall’s amendment will be included. Sen. Lummis noted that the recess could allow the credit card issue to "germinate," increasing the uncertainty around the stablecoin bill's future. Merchant Payments Coalition supports the amendment, stating, "it is time for Congress to deal with the hidden credit card fees driving up the prices of nearly everything we buy" (Doug Kantor). Electronic Payments Coalition opposes, arguing that groups are working "behind the scenes to see the Durbin-Marshall mandates hung like an albatross around the bill’s neck" (Richard Hunt).

#### Why does this matter?
**Political Dynamics:** The article highlights the complex political dynamics and lobbying efforts surrounding cryptocurrency regulation and financial policy, showcasing how seemingly unrelated issues can become intertwined and threaten the passage of legislation. The deep divisions within the Republican party, exemplified by Vice President Vance's shifting stance, illustrate the challenges of navigating competing interests.
**Economic Impact:** The potential changes to credit card swipe fees could have significant economic consequences for consumers, retailers, and financial institutions. The differing perspectives on the impact of these fees demonstrate the need for a comprehensive understanding of the economic effects of regulatory changes.
