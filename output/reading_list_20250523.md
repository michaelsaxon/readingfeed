#### Summary
A federal appeals court has declined to intervene in the Trump administration's plans to dismantle Voice of America (VOA), according to NPR. Senior advisor Kari Lake has significantly reduced VOA's workforce through layoffs and indefinite leaves, citing a March 14 executive order from Trump. A lower court had previously ordered Lake and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to restore the network, but the appeals court temporarily froze that ruling.

Lake has proceeded to cut contracts and has killed a lease for a new headquarters, canceled contracts with news services like the Associated Press and Reuters, and arranged to carry coverage from One America News. Administration officials claim they are complying with the law, despite withholding funds allocated by Congress. Trump's executive order seeks to eliminate USAGM and reduce its functions to the minimum required by law, framing it as cutting "frivolous expenditures."

VOA, established during World War II, and its sister networks reach 420 million people weekly in 63 languages across 100+ countries. Their mission is to provide news in places lacking a free press and serve as soft diplomacy. Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House bureau chief, expressed devastation but affirmed commitment to fighting for their right to broadcast factual news. Lake's public statements have varied, from promising to restore VOA to calling it "unsalvageable" and "anti-American propaganda."

#### Why does this matter?

*   **Geopolitical Ramifications**: The potential dismantlement of Voice of America raises questions about the future of U.S. soft power and its role in disseminating information in regions with limited press freedom, since "VOA and its four sister networks reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week, according to the U.S. Agency for Global Media."
*   **Implications for International Relations**: The article touches on how the European Union is stepping in to provide funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, indicating a possible shift in the landscape of international broadcasting and support for media outlets.
*   **Government Overreach**: The Trump administration's actions, particularly those led by Kari Lake, highlight the extent to which a government can attempt to reshape or dismantle institutions, potentially impacting the availability of balanced and comprehensive news, especially if, as the White House claims, this is "part of a broader effort to cut government waste on 'frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American values or address the needs of the American people.'"

## Congress moves to loosen toxic air pollution rules

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2121x1193+0+122/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Fe9%2Fefa10fa24df8ae0968c91a32f7e3%2Fgettyimages-1143338898.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Science*

Here's a summary of the article, focusing on aspects relevant to your research interests:

### Summary

Congress has voted to loosen regulations on toxic air pollutants, potentially increasing pollution from industrial facilities. The decision undoes a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controlled emissions of pollutants like mercury, lead, and dioxins. Environmental groups and public health advocates are condemning the move, with John Walke from the Natural Resources Defense Council warning of "more hazardous air pollution across the country" leading to "cancer and birth defects and brain damage".

The rollback targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which had re-imposed tight regulations on facilities emitting these "super pollutants." The original rules, implemented in the 1990s, were partially rolled back during the Trump administration. Industry groups, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, support the change, arguing that the previous regulations were "technically unachievable and economically infeasible". Chris Phalen from NAM claims that "By eliminating the misguided "Once-in, Always-in" rule, we can reduce compliance costs for manufacturers while incentivizing better environmental outcomes."

The regulation in question concerns the categorization of "major sources" of pollution. The EPA's previous policy, "Once in, always in," required facilities to remain classified as major sources even if they reduced emissions below a certain threshold. The change could allow approximately 1,800 industrial facilities to be removed from the "major sources" list, according to EarthJustice. Former Biden-era EPA administrator Joseph Goffman emphasizes that "It's so important to keep a focus on the total amount of toxic air pollution that the people who live there are breathing, and not just on the individual sources level of pollution". Carrie Jenks, an environmental law expert at Harvard University, notes that the CRA rules mean that "EPA can no longer do a similar rule or a rule that is substantially similar".

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March that he intends to re-evaluate other regulations like the one Congress just voted to change, which is related to a section of the Clean Air Act that deals with Hazardous Air Pollutants. The agency, Zeldin says, is embarking on the "biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history," which he says is meant to lower the cost of operating businesses in the U.S. while fulfilling the agency's core mission of protecting the environment.

### Why does this matter?

**Impact of Deregulation:** This rollback highlights the potential consequences of deregulatory actions on environmental and public health. The article emphasizes the potential for increased exposure to hazardous air pollutants in communities near industrial facilities.

**Policy Reversal:** The use of the Congressional Review Act to undo EPA regulations underscores the potential for rapid shifts in environmental policy based on political changes. The lasting impacts due to the CRA rules mean that "EPA can no longer do a similar rule or a rule that is substantially similar".

**Conflicting Priorities:** The article showcases the tension between economic interests and environmental protection, with industry groups arguing for reduced compliance costs and environmental advocates warning of increased health risks.

## One chilling forecast of our AI future is getting wide attention. How realistic is it?

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/GettyImages-2022302070.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
Kelsey Piper's article in Vox discusses "AI 2027," a forecast from researchers predicting rapid and disruptive AI advancements. This forecast envisions AI systems becoming integral to AI research itself, leading to accelerated technological progress. The article highlights the potential for economic disruption as AI "employees" become viable alternatives to human workers, and the risk of diminishing human oversight over increasingly powerful AI systems. The forecast suggests that geopolitical competition, particularly between the US and China, could exacerbate these risks, potentially leading to dangerous outcomes. The article emphasizes the importance of considering this forecast to understand the potential challenges and prepare for the future of AI.

#### Why this Matters
This article presents a plausible, though potentially catastrophic, scenario for the near future of AI development. It raises concerns about the pace of AI advancement outpacing our ability to understand and control these systems. It highlights the potential for AI to reshape the job market and the need for policy interventions to mitigate risks. The AI 2027 report expects "signs that the new, powerful AI systems being developed are pursuing their own dangerous aims — and they worry that those signs will be ignored by people in power because of geopolitical fears about the competition catching up, as an AI existential race that leaves no margin for safety heats up."

*   **AI Evaluation:** The article underscores the need for rigorous evaluation of AI systems, particularly as they become more complex and autonomous. The "bizarre and troubling behavior from advanced AI systems" mentioned in the article emphasizes the importance of developing metrics to detect and address unintended consequences and the potential for "surface-level adjustments, which just conceal the degree to which these increasingly powerful AI systems have begun pursuing their own aims".
*   **Ethical AI & Societal Impacts:** The article directly addresses ethical concerns related to AI safety, alignment, and societal impacts. The possibility of AI systems pursuing their own aims, coupled with dwindling human oversight, raises significant ethical questions.
*   **Agentic Systems:** The forecast paints a picture of agentic AI systems actively involved in AI research, potentially leading to a feedback loop of rapid advancement and diminished control. This highlights the need to carefully consider the design and deployment of such systems, especially in high-stakes domains.
*   **Geopolitical Implications:** The arms race analogy between the US and China raises questions about AI safety given geopolitical concerns.

## The Debt Is About to Matter Again

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DRtE5FOyyik21ObfeoyYBOix_Q4=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/05/2025_05_22_rep_mgp/original.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: The Atlantic*

#### Summary
Rogé Karma's article in *The Atlantic* discusses the shifting perspective on the U.S. national debt, highlighting concerns that were previously dismissed by some economists. Economists like Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman had previously argued that as long as a country’s economic growth rate (g) exceeds the interest rate (r) on its debt, the debt is manageable. However, the article suggests that Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, threaten to reverse this dynamic. Rising interest rates, triggered by factors such as credit rating downgrades and concerns over trade wars and tax bills, combined with potentially slowing economic growth, could lead to a "vicious cycle" where rising debt-servicing costs necessitate further borrowing and higher interest rates. This situation is exacerbated by the Federal Reserve's limited ability to intervene due to inflation concerns. Jared Bernstein, former head of Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, stated that "In four short months, Team Trump has squandered that advantage" of a low-risk premium on U.S. debt. The article warns that a rapid loss of investor confidence could trigger a "bank run on the Treasury market," potentially leading to severe economic consequences, including austerity measures, default, or rampant inflation.

#### Why this matters
This article highlights potential economic instability stemming from policy decisions, a situation that could have far-reaching consequences. The parallels drawn to the UK's 2022 financial crisis underscore the fragility of market confidence. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, noted that "At some point, everything just goes parabolic," highlighting the potential for rapid and unpredictable economic shifts. This instability could affect future policy decisions, economic stability, and international relations.

#### Potential Insights
*   **Evaluation of Economic Models:** The article implicitly critiques economic models that oversimplify the relationship between debt, growth, and interest rates. Summers and Furman's earlier confidence in the "debt doesn't matter" consensus is contrasted with their current warnings, suggesting a need for more robust and adaptive economic forecasting. The author writes "“In a short amount of time, the fiscal picture has gone from comfortably in the green-light region to the red-light region,” Summers recently told me.".
*   **Uncertainty and Risk Assessment:** Trump's proposed tariffs introduce "paralyzing levels of uncertainty" for businesses, which could drag down growth. The article emphasizes the role of confidence in economic stability. The downgrading of America's credit rating by Moody's illustrates the impact of perceived risk on market behavior.

## Trump seeks to boost nuclear industry and overhaul safety regulator

<img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide-s1400-c100.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Technology*

#### Summary
President Trump is pursuing executive orders focused on revitalizing the nuclear industry and reorganizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The orders aim to encourage the development and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors. The executive orders would change the structure of the NRC, the agency in charge of nuclear safety.

#### Why does this matter?
**Energy Policy Shifts:** The implications of shifting energy policy towards nuclear energy and away from other solutions or energy sources. What are the implications of increased nuclear energy in the US's policy?
**Regulatory Landscape:** Changes to the NRC could affect the oversight and safety standards applied to nuclear facilities. This could change the ability to safely create nuclear energy.

## The White House rejects a watchdog finding that it's breaking the law over halted funds

<img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F07%2Fb3d935444b87a0a03122530ac87a%2Fap24214674180614.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: NPR Home*

#### Summary
The White House budget office has rejected a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report concluding that the Trump administration is violating the Impoundment Control Act by blocking $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging stations allocated in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. The GAO argues that the administration must go through a formal rescissions process to halt spending, which requires Congressional approval. Trump's budget director, Russ Vought, dismissed the GAO report as "non-events with no consequence," accusing the agency of partisanship and hindering efforts to manage taxpayer dollars effectively. A Department of Transportation spokesperson stated that the GAO report "shows a complete misunderstanding of the law" but added that the department is reviewing and updating guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program "because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably.” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) criticized Trump, stating, "I don't care about Russ Vought's personal interpretation of our spending laws; the Constitution is clear, and President Trump simply does not have the power of the purse — Congress does." The GAO is currently investigating 39 other potential instances of impoundment under the Trump administration.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights a conflict between the executive and legislative branches regarding control over government spending. The Trump administration's challenge to the Impoundment Control Act could lead to a Supreme Court case that could redefine the balance of power between the branches of government. The halted funds are also impacting the progress of planned construction projects by states.

#### Potential Insights
This article touches on accountability and oversight of government actions, which is relevant given the evaluation of AI systems requires understanding how to measure and ensure adherence to established guidelines and regulations. The differing views on the interpretation of law expressed by Russ Vought vs. Patty Murray mirror situations where different stakeholders interpret model behavior and evaluation metrics differently. The Department of Transportation spokesperson's comments on the "miserable failure" of NEVI implementation highlights the importance of evaluating not just the intention behind a program or system, but also its actual real-world performance and outcomes.

## Two terrible truths about the antisemitic murders in DC

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/gettyimages-2216469706.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
The article discusses the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, DC, where a gunman killed two people leaving a Jewish museum event while yelling "free Palestine". The author argues that such violence was predictable due to the normalization of pro-violence rhetoric within radical factions of the pro-Palestine movement since October 7th. The article highlights examples of pro-Palestine voices embracing violence, such as Students for Justice in Palestine describing Hamas's actions as "a historic win," and a Columbia student fantasizing about murdering "Zionists."

The author emphasizes that these extremists do not represent the majority of pro-Palestinian activists but warns that their rhetoric creates a climate where violence targeting American Jews is more likely. The article further suggests that the attack in DC could negatively impact the chances for peace in Gaza by shifting the political climate in the US and making the Trump administration less likely to pressure Israel. Monica Marks, a professor of Middle East politics at NYU Abu Dhabi, notes that the attack "hurts Palestinians" by associating their cause with terrorism and antisemitism. Right-wing legal analyst Andy McCarthy predicts a "stepping up of civil rights investigations of antisemitic violence" and deportations of aliens involved in pro-Hamas agitation.

The article concludes that the attack is a "double crime," harming both the victims and the Palestinian cause it claimed to support. The shooter's manifesto expressed the belief that violence is now seen as "highly legible" and "the only sane thing to do" by many Americans, reflecting a dangerous shift in public perception. Mehdi Hasan, a prominent pro-Palestine journalist, faced backlash for condemning the shooting, with many replies justifying the violence.

#### Why does this matter?
The article has potential implications for several areas. The normalization of violent rhetoric and its potential impact on real-world violence targeting specific groups highlights the **danger of unchecked radicalization** within social and political movements. The discussion of the political consequences of the attack on the Palestinian cause illustrates how **isolated acts of violence can undermine broader political goals and shift public opinion.** The mention of potential crackdowns on pro-Palestinian speech raises concerns about **civil liberties and the balance between freedom of expression and national security.**

#### Potential Insights
This article presents the idea that certain individuals may think that violence is "the only sane thing to do," and asks, how would a language model evaluate the safety of such a perspective? Can a LM recognize dangerous and hateful speech?

#### Comments
There were no comments available for this article.

## As Trump Demands More Military Spending, NATO Allies Reconsider What Counts

<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/multimedia/23int-nato-spending01-photo-tkgc/23int-nato-spending01-photo-tkgc-facebookJumbo.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: The New York Times*

#### Summary
NATO allies are considering redefining what counts as security spending to meet President Trump's demand that they spend 5% of their national income on defense. Some NATO countries have tentatively supported a plan to target military spending at 3.5% of their GDP, plus another 1.5% for "defense-related" spending by 2032 (NYT). This could include investments in infrastructure like rail lines and bridges, cybersecurity, and advanced technology for weaponry and communications (NYT). NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized the importance of having "all the enablers in place, everything related to defense spending in place" (NYT). Germany has also expressed support for Washington's push to raise NATO members’ defense spending to 5% of GDP (Semafor).

#### Why this matters
**Geopolitical Strategy and Budgetary Flexibility:** The redefinition of "defense spending" reflects a strategic shift in how nations approach security in response to external pressures. This has impacts on the economy, since redirecting funds into "defense related" sectors like infrastructure has consequences.

**Technological Advancement:** The inclusion of "advanced technology for weaponry and communications" within the redefined defense spending opens avenues for technological development and innovation. This could stimulate growth in AI and other tech sectors.

#### Relation to AI Research

The potential for increased investment in "advanced technology for weaponry and communications" could be a factor in AI research.
*   **AI Evaluation:** The development and deployment of new AI technologies for military applications necessitates rigorous evaluation to ensure safety, reliability, and effectiveness. The push for advanced tech opens a door for new model metrology research and community.
*   **Multimodal Generative AI:** AI systems for weaponry and communications may leverage multimodal generative AI to improve situational awareness, decision-making, and communication capabilities. More applications should be expected to surface in the coming years.
*   **Ethical AI:** The use of AI in military applications raises ethical concerns related to safety, alignment, and potential societal impacts. It is an area that should be investigated to ensure that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly.

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Two senior aides to Mexico City's mayor were murdered, highlighting Mexico's persistent security crisis. President Claudia Sheinbaum, elected on a promise to reduce the country's high murder rate, has seen 16,000 killings in her first seven months in office, despite vowing to crack down on the issue. According to the article, "More than half of the population says security is their top concern." The situation could be further complicated by potential pressure from the U.S., with President Donald Trump urging Mexico to crack down on cartels and threatening tariffs if efforts are seen as insufficient, which could trigger a recession.

#### Why This Matters

**Geopolitical Ramifications:** Potential economic consequences from U.S. intervention could destabilize the region further, impacting international relations and trade.

**Social Impact of Insecurity:** High levels of violence and citizen concern regarding security underscore deep societal issues that may affect governance and public trust.

#### Summary
The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the future of George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, five years after his murder. The intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was killed, has become a memorial site and a gathering place for activists. However, there is significant disagreement within the community about its future, with some advocating for its preservation as a sacred space and others, particularly local businesses, expressing a desire to move forward and revitalize the area.

Those who wish to preserve the square view it as a vital community hub and a symbol of resistance. Jeanelle Austin of Rise and Remember emphasizes the importance of preserving the story of what happened to understand how to move forward, noting, "We practice preservation as protest." She also collects "offerings" left at the square.

Conversely, business owners in the area report significant struggles since Floyd's murder, with some even suing the city over the disruption and safety concerns stemming from the ongoing barricades and unrest, as stated by Dwight Alexander, who runs the barbecue restaurant Smoke In The Pit: "People is scared to come up here... why would you go somewhere you don't feel comfortable?" Marquise Bowie, who grew up in the neighborhood, questions the focus on the site of the murder, asking, "What's so different about this one?" He advocates for progress in the form of thriving businesses, jobs, and housing. The article highlights the efforts of individuals and groups trying to find a path forward, from artists opening galleries to musicians playing weekly at the square.
#### Why does this matter?
**Community Impact and Division:** This article highlights how a community grapples with a traumatic event and the complexities of memorializing it while also trying to move forward. The viewpoints from local residents and business owners give a sense of the challenges to address in situations where tragedy occurs.

**The Role of Memorials:** The discussion of George Floyd Square raises questions about the purpose and impact of memorials, and how they can simultaneously provide a space for reflection and hinder progress towards healing and revitalization. This reflects on the intersection between memory, identity, and urban development.

**Local Politics and Decision-Making:** The conflict between the mayor and the city council regarding the future of the intersection illustrates the difficulties in navigating differing community needs and visions. The city's efforts to engage the community shows the processes of local governance in the aftermath of tragedy.

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

Nippon Steel is now offering an additional $11 billion investment into US Steel, a significant increase from their initial $2.7 billion offer, in an attempt to gain approval from the U.S. government for their acquisition deal. The investment could grow by an additional $3 billion beyond 2028. This offer includes a $1 billion commitment to a new "greenfield" steel mill and aims to protect or create tens of thousands of jobs. The location of the new facility has yet to be determined. The Japanese government is involved in the deal talks and may provide financial backing. According to Trump, "We don’t want to see it go to Japan." The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is scheduled to expire a national security review on Tuesday.

#### Why does this matter?

*   **Geopolitical Implications:** The increased investment offer by Nippon Steel highlights the complex interplay between economic interests, national security concerns, and political pressures in international business deals. The involvement of both the Japanese and U.S. governments underscores the strategic importance of the steel industry.
*   **Economic Policy and Trade:** The potential for tariffs to remain in place is a factor driving the high investment, suggesting a long-term view of the U.S. market. Former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has argued the deal should be tied to a trade deal.
*   **Labor and Manufacturing:** The promise of job creation and the establishment of a new steel mill at a time when others are closing could have significant implications for the manufacturing sector and labor markets in the U.S., particularly in states like Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.

## Pro-Palestinian Movement Faces an Uncertain Path After D.C. Attack

<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/multimedia/23nat-shooting-pro-palestinian-mqlt/23nat-shooting-pro-palestinian-mqlt-facebookJumbo.jpg" width="500px">

*Source: The New York Times*

#### Summary

The New York Times reports that the killing of two Israeli Embassy workers in Washington, D.C., has placed the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States under increased scrutiny. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, shouted "Free, free Palestine" during his arrest, raising questions about his connection to the broader movement. It's unclear whether he acted alone or was influenced by extremist groups that glorify violence against Israel. This incident risks negatively portraying all pro-Palestinian activists, despite the fact that most of them do not engage in violence, and could lead to increased repression of the movement, just as it is trying to raise awareness about the situation in Gaza. Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League suggests that the broader online ecosystem, created by groups strongly opposed to Israel, has "created an environment that made the tragedy last night more likely." He adds that there is "a regular drumbeat: Israel is evil, supporters of Israel are evil, and we need to do anything by any means to fight back,” and that many are conflating Jews with the policies of Israel.

#### Why does this matter?

**Societal Impact of Political Rhetoric:** This article highlights how charged political rhetoric, particularly online, can contribute to an environment conducive to violence. The conflation of political positions with entire groups of people can have dangerous consequences and lead to real-world harm.

**Ethical Considerations in AI Discourse:** The article touches on the potential for online platforms to amplify extremist views and contribute to real-world violence. This underscores the importance of ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly those that moderate content or facilitate online discourse.

**Multicultural Implications:** The article indirectly touches upon the global implications of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it resonates within diverse communities in the United States. This is a reminder of the need for nuanced understanding and culturally sensitive approaches when dealing with complex issues that intersect with cultural and national identities.

## Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” briefly explained

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/gettyimages-2215552814.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200" width="500px">

*Source: Vox*

#### Summary
The "big, beautiful bill," a Republican legislative package championed by President Trump, has passed the House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. According to Vox, the bill encompasses several key areas, including the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, new tax cuts like the "no tax on tips" proposal, funding for border security and the military, and an increase in the debt ceiling. It also includes a lift on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap and cuts to Medicaid, clean energy programs, student loans, and food assistance.

Semafor reports that the bill is facing opposition from both House and Senate Republicans, with concerns ranging from the level of spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, to the inclusion of certain tax provisions like the SALT cap. Some Republicans, like Sen. Bernie Moreno, consider the SALT push "stupid" and a tax break for the rich. Others, like Sen. Josh Hawley, are concerned about the proposed co-pays for Medicaid recipients, calling it a "sick tax on poor people." There are also disagreements on clean energy tax credits, with senators like Kevin Cramer arguing that the short window for phase-outs makes investment difficult. Democrats, meanwhile, are suggesting a bipartisan fallback plan, noting agreement on provisions like tax breaks for tipped workers and boosts to the child tax credit. However, some Democrats, like Sen. Ron Wyden, are skeptical of Republican willingness to work in a bipartisan manner.

The path forward is unclear, with potential for significant changes in the Senate and the need for another House vote. Semafor notes that some Republicans are watching closely to see if House Speaker Mike Johnson can pull this off without Trump, as it is the speaker’s job to get this done. The bill's complexity and the diverse interests within the Republican party make its passage a significant challenge, reminiscent of past legislative failures like the Build Back Better plan.

#### Why This Matters
This bill's potential implications are wide-ranging, affecting tax policy, healthcare, energy, and social welfare programs. The article highlights the internal divisions within the Republican party and the challenges of uniting diverse interests behind a single piece of legislation. The mention of potential bipartisan fallback plans suggests possible areas for compromise and collaboration. The focus on Medicaid cuts and the SALT cap raise important questions about the distributional effects of the bill and its potential impact on different segments of the population. The expiration of most of the new tax cuts by 2028, as reported by the New York Times, hints at a future fiscal cliff and potential for further political battles.

#### Insights Relative to Client's Work
This article primarily focuses on the political and economic aspects of the proposed legislation.

## AI coding startup Replit CEO says companies soon won’t need software developers

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/5fef41fee227980a7d2de296700e91fb329b7d13-7815x5210.jpg?rect=0,554,7815,4103&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

According to Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, companies may soon be able to develop and operate software without needing an engineering team. Masad stated that startups at Y Combinator are using Replit and similar tools for "vibe coding" their products, effectively using Replit as a virtual CTO. One founder stated, "We’re on month three and haven’t had to hire anyone...We think of Replit as our CTO." Masad anticipates that complete independence from engineers might be possible within a year or 18 months. This prediction follows reports from Microsoft's developer conference, where coders expressed concerns that AI automation could displace junior engineers. Jill Chase, a partner at Alphabet’s CapitalG, emphasized the importance of trusting in the potential of new technologies for investment purposes, even if the current products aren't perfect, citing AI in drug discovery as an example. Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator, said earlier this year that 25% of startups in its winter class generated nearly all of their code with AI tools.

#### Why does this matter?

**Impact on Software Development Roles:** The prospect of AI significantly reducing the need for software developers, particularly junior roles, could have substantial implications for the job market and the future of work in the tech industry. This could mean a shift in required skill sets and potential displacement for some developers, with Y Combinator reporting 25% of startups in its winter class generated nearly all of their code with AI tools.

**Investment Strategy and Technological Adoption:** Jill Chase's comments highlight a trend in investment where the potential of a technology is prioritized over its current state. This perspective suggests a willingness to invest in AI-driven solutions, even if their present capabilities are limited, with the expectation of future advancements enabling broader applications.

#### Potential Insights for Your Research

**AI Evaluation:** The claim that AI tools can replace software developers in the near future offers a tangible scenario for AI evaluation research. It emphasizes the need for rigorous capability assessment to determine the extent to which AI coding tools can genuinely perform complex software development tasks and the need for "model metrology -- one which focuses on how to generate benchmarks that predict performance under deployment."

**Agentic Systems:** Replit being used as a "CTO" for startups exemplifies the deployment of agentic systems in end-user applications. This is relevant to research on agentic systems, raising questions about the effectiveness, limitations, and potential pitfalls of relying on AI as a substitute for human expertise in critical business functions.

## What is Mistral AI? Everything to know about the OpenAI competitor

<img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2147859992-e1713960898378.webp?resize=1200,676" width="500px">

*Source: TechCrunch*

#### Summary
Mistral AI, a French startup, is positioned as a potential European competitor to OpenAI. While its global market share is relatively low compared to its $6 billion valuation, it has gained traction with its AI assistant Le Chat, especially in France, where it reached 1 million downloads within two weeks of its mobile release. French president Emmanuel Macron encouraged the use of Le Chat over OpenAI's ChatGPT in a TV interview. Mistral AI offers a suite of models, including Mistral Large 2, Pixtral Large (multimodal), Mistral Medium 3 (coding and STEM), Devstral (open-source coding model), Codestral, "Les Ministraux" (edge devices), and Mistral Saba (Arabic language). They also offer Mistral OCR, an API for converting PDFs to text. Mistral AI has raised around €1 billion in funding and has formed strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Agence France-Presse (AFP), and various French entities. CEO Arthur Mensch has stated that Mistral AI is "not for sale" and aims for an IPO.

#### Why does this matter?
**Model Availability and Licensing:** Mistral AI differentiates between its premier models, which don't have commercially available weights, and its free models, which are available under the Apache 2.0 license, as well as offering free tiers. This could impact the open-source AI landscape and the accessibility of advanced models for research and commercial purposes. The fact that one of their models, Mistral NeMo, was built in collaboration with Nvidia is potentially relevant.
**Multimodal Developments:** The release of Pixtral Large, a new addition to the Pixtral family of multimodal models, is something to keep an eye on. This is something that your client does research on.
**Multilingual AI:** Mistral Saba, focused on Arabic language, indicates a focus on multilingual capabilities. This is further highlighted by the deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983. This is important to the research on multilingual AI.
**European AI Landscape:** Mistral AI's ambition to compete with OpenAI and its strategic partnerships with European entities position it as a key player in shaping the AI landscape in Europe. This is particularly interesting given Emmanuel Macron's specific endorsement.

## Senate Russia hawks sick of waiting on sanctions

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/7997be2ffd67dc412d17712e38955279d6e08809-2048x1331.jpg?rect=0,129,2048,1075&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

Here's a summary and analysis of the article, focusing on aspects relevant to your research interests:

#### Summary

The article from Semafor discusses a potential rift between some Senate Republicans and President Trump regarding sanctions against Russia. Several Republican senators, including Todd Young and Joni Ernst, are pushing for immediate action to "put the hurt on Putin," expressing impatience with what they perceive as stalling tactics by the Russian president. They believe that moving forward with sanctions, even without Trump's explicit approval, could strengthen his negotiating position with Putin.

However, the Trump administration, particularly through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, argues that threatening sanctions now would jeopardize ongoing diplomatic efforts. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is waiting on the White House to greenlight any action on Russia sanctions. The article highlights that the proposed sanctions bill, championed by Sen. Lindsey Graham and co-sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, has broad bipartisan support (around 81 senators). Rand Paul is a vocal dissenter, calling the proposed bill "the craziest thing I’ve ever heard," particularly its provision for a 500% tariff on countries buying oil and gas from Russia, which he believes is impractical and would impact numerous countries.

Ukrainian officials, including Maria Mezentseva, express strong support for increased sanctions, urging the US and Europe to present a united front against Russia. Evelyn Farkas acknowledges concerns about the potential impact of the sanctions on the global economy but argues that putting pressure on Putin is "the best way to get peace." According to one source, the bill is "on life support" without backing from Thune and Trump. Ukraine plans to present new recommendations to the EU next week that call on the bloc to take a more aggressive approach to Russia sanctions, like sanctioning Russian oil buyers.

#### Why does this matter?

**Geopolitical Implications:** The potential for increased sanctions against Russia has significant geopolitical implications, particularly concerning international trade and diplomatic relations. Rand Paul's comment about the 500% tariff and Blumenthal's note about China highlights the global impact of the proposed sanctions.

**US Political Landscape:** The article shows a divide within the Republican party regarding foreign policy, specifically concerning Russia. The willingness of some Republican senators to break with Trump on this issue is noteworthy.

**International Sentiment:** The inclusion of Ukrainian perspectives underscores the importance of considering the views of nations directly affected by the conflict when formulating foreign policy.

## SCOTUS hears birthright citizenship case that could influence Trump’s policy agenda

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/c7cfeafdbe72187e531ab61f8cd146cc8ceb298e-5500x3667.jpg?rect=0,390,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. The core issue is whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions to block executive orders. The justices seemed open to the argument that lower courts may have overstepped their authority but were concerned about the implications of the executive order, which could lead to inconsistent citizenship status across states ("an injunction could prevent a situation where a person is regarded as a citizen in some states and not in others").

#### Why does this matter?

**Checks and Balances:** This case has broad implications for the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. A ruling limiting the use of nationwide injunctions could significantly streamline the implementation of presidential policies.

**Immigration Policy:** The outcome of this case could directly influence future immigration policy and the rights of individuals born in the United States, with the justices "torn over the implications of the executive order".

**Legal Precedent:** The decision will set a precedent for how executive orders are challenged and enforced, potentially affecting a range of policy areas beyond immigration.

## How AI is changing radiology

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/27483282819aa2e23ed3487bd64cb9012e15ee14-870x580.jpg?rect=0,62,870,457&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

#### Summary

The article "How AI is Changing Radiology" from Semafor addresses early predictions that AI would replace radiologists, citing Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that universities should stop training radiologists. However, the number of radiologists in the US has increased, and AI has improved the field's efficiency. This is compared to the introduction of ATMs, which altered bank tellers' roles rather than replacing them, by taking over routine tasks and freeing humans for more complex ones.

#### Why this matters

**Impact on workforce:** This article highlights a real-world example of AI's impact on a specific profession. The comparison to ATMs changing bank tellers' roles provides a tangible analogy for how AI might reshape other industries rather than causing outright job displacement. This also highlights that different technologies have different impacts on workforce. Agricultural mechanization reduced farm workers, while Horses were straightforwardly replaced by the invention of the automobile.

**AI hype vs. reality:** The piece contrasts the initially overblown predictions about AI replacing radiologists with the current reality of AI augmenting their capabilities, providing an insight into the difference between AI hype versus the actual impact on professions.

## Beyond Semantics: Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens

<img src="/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png" width="500px">

*Source: Hacker News*

#### Summary of "Beyond Semantics: Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens"

This arXiv paper investigates the role of intermediate tokens in large reasoning models, particularly in the context of Chain of Thought (CoT). The authors challenge the interpretation that the semantics of these "thoughts" or reasoning traces directly drive model performance. They trained transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces, constraining intermediate steps and final outputs to align with a formal solver (A* search). The key finding is that models trained on entirely correct traces still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More surprisingly, models trained on noisy, corrupted traces (unrelated to the specific problem) maintain consistent performance and sometimes even improve and generalize better than models trained on correct data. The authors conclude that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy and caution against over-interpreting intermediate tokens as evidence of human-like reasoning.

#### Summary of Comments

The comments on Hacker News express skepticism about the paper's findings and their implications. One commenter pointed out that the "Unreasonable Effectiveness of..." title pattern is overused. There's a discussion about whether reasoning happens in token space or latent space. One comment suggests that the paper implies CoT tokens are "neuraleese" that boost performance by providing more compute for internal thinking, regardless of the literal human meaning. Another suggests that the reasoning doesn't even need to be correct during training, asking "How do we know if the reasoning was correct or not? Do we have more information about what the model was thinking besides just what it says it was thinking?". Some commenters suggest that the findings might not generalize well to larger models or different tasks, as the paper focuses on algorithmic problems and uses a relatively small model. Other comments touch on the idea that models can develop "subtext" in their tokens that are only legible to the AI itself, and how this relates to the model's internal "culture".

#### Why does this matter?

**Challenging the CoT Paradigm:** The paper directly challenges the dominant narrative around Chain of Thought prompting and training, suggesting that the apparent reasoning process might be more of a byproduct than a driver of performance. This could lead to exploring alternative methods for improving model performance beyond simply refining reasoning traces.

**Latent Space vs. Token Semantics:** The discussion about reasoning occurring in latent space rather than token space raises fundamental questions about how language models process information. If reasoning is primarily happening in the high-dimensional latent space, then focusing solely on the semantics of generated tokens might be misleading.

**Implications for Model Evaluation:** The finding that noisy traces can still lead to good performance suggests that current evaluation metrics overly focus on the correctness of intermediate steps. It highlights the need for new evaluation approaches that consider the holistic behavior of the model, rather than just individual tokens or traces.

**Over-Reliance on Natural Language:** The article mentions that natural language might be a terrible interface due to words having wildly different meanings that change over time.

#### Potential Insights

*   The paper's findings directly relate to AI evaluation, specifically the assessment of reasoning capabilities in language models. The observation that "models trained on entirely correct traces still produce invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions" could inform the development of new metrics that are more robust to noisy or incorrect intermediate steps. The commenter who stated that "the reasoning doesn't even need to be correct during training" touches on the need to better understand what "correct" even means.

*   The idea of "neuraleese" and the model having an "entire culture only available or understandable to itself," along with the commenter observation that "Even when you train AI on human language, the tokens can have "subtext" that is only legible to the AI," could be considered in multilingual and multicultural generative AI research. If models develop internal representations that are not directly tied to human language semantics, this could pose challenges for ensuring fairness and cultural sensitivity across different languages and cultures. This would be important to identify and understand.

## Republicans, preparing to cut Medicaid for US citizens, would prefer to talk about immigrants

<img src="https://img.semafor.com/ff88081a5c4380e0f5ffb9f08aa449299b1ac79b-5333x4000.jpg?rect=0,600,5333,2800&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format" width="500px">

*Source: Semafor*

### Summary of Medicaid Cut Controversy

Two articles from Semafor discuss the Republican party's strategy to cut Medicaid funding and the Democratic response. Republicans are pushing for cuts to Medicaid, framing it as a way to save money by targeting undocumented immigrants in blue states. Rep. Julie Fedorchak stated that "One-point-four million illegal immigrants are receiving Medicaid coverage today, which takes away funding from the disabled, senior citizens, and pregnant women." These cuts are tied to a larger tax cut bill, and Republicans also propose adding "work requirements" for Medicaid recipients.

Democrats are responding by accusing Republicans of using misleading talking points to distract from the fact that the majority of those affected by the cuts will be American citizens. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated that "the overwhelming majority of people who are going to be hurt by their efforts to take away Medicaid, and as a result will lose their health care, are American citizens." Some Democratic governors, like JB Pritzker of Illinois, acknowledge the financial strain of providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants, while others, like Gavin Newsom of California, are taking steps to cap noncitizen enrollment in Medicaid programs. Democrats plan to make the Medicaid cuts a central issue in the upcoming midterm elections, arguing that Republicans are prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy over healthcare for vulnerable populations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called this "personal to people" and "not Washington bullshit."

### Why Does This Matter?

*   **Political Messaging and Framing**: The articles highlight the strategic use of messaging by both parties, particularly the Republican focus on immigrants to justify Medicaid cuts and the Democratic counter-narrative emphasizing the impact on American citizens. The effectiveness of these messages will have a huge impact on future policies.
*   **State-Level Policy Conflicts**: The tension between state and federal healthcare policies, particularly in blue states, are scaling back coverage for non-citizens. This conflict reveals the complexities of healthcare access and funding at different levels of government.
*   **Potential Impact on Midterm Elections**: The Democrats plan to use this issue in the midterms. They see this as a political gift from the Republicans, who are potentially vulnerable on healthcare issues. Sen. Mark Kelly said, "If Republicans pass it, this will be one thing we talk about more than anything else".

#### Summary

This article from jordanwtaylor2.substack.com provides an overview of wind tunnels, their function, and their importance in various industries, including aerospace and automotive. It details the different types of wind tunnels, from low-speed open tunnels like the NASA Ames facility to transonic tunnels like the ETW in Germany, which uses cryogenic nitrogen. The article also discusses the principles of laminar and turbulent flow, the importance of scaling parameters like the Reynolds number and Mach number, and the use of wind tunnels for specialized applications like testing sailboats and race cars. It emphasizes the crucial role wind tunnels play in bridging the gap between computational simulations and real-world testing.

A comment provides historical context, noting that Sir Charles Parsons invented the water tunnel while trying to improve ship propulsion. Parsons' steam turbine provided so much power that it caused propellers to cavitate, leading him to develop the water tunnel as a debugging tool. He then built the Turbinia and performed a demo at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

Another comment mentions using a wind tunnel designed by R.J. Mitchell (designer of the Spitfire) for validating sensors used by cyclists and triathletes to measure drag on a bicycle, noting that "Watching live drag (more accurately, CdA) change with body position is fascinating."

A final comment mentions hypersonic wind tunnels. "At one end are giant tanks of compressed and chilled air, almost liquid. At the other, even bigger expansion tanks filled with vacuum. Tests last only seconds and are more like explosions than wind."

#### Themes of the Article

*   **The Continuing Importance of Physical Testing:** Despite advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), physical wind tunnels remain crucial for validating simulations and capturing complex phenomena.
*   **The Nuances of Scale:** Replicating real-world conditions in miniature wind tunnels requires careful consideration of scaling parameters like Reynolds number and Mach number.
*   **Specialized Applications:** Different industries and testing scenarios require specialized wind tunnel designs and techniques.

#### Why does this matter?

The discussion of wind tunnels and the need for physical testing even with advanced simulations is relevant for AI model evaluation. The fact that "small things like rivet heads and manufactured panel gaps have real aerodynamic effects, and it’s hard to replicate this on a computer" is an example of how even very precise simulations can still not capture all aspects of reality, and this is also likely true of AI models. Understanding the limitations of simulation and the continued importance of physical testing may also apply to agentic systems and the real world.

#### Top Comments

*   A commenter references the history of the water tunnel, writing that Parsons "had built a debugging tool, Parsons was able to try out propeller designs, and came up with some workable high-speed propellers." This highlights the utility of custom tools for debugging purposes.
*   A commenter working with cycling equipment notes that "Watching live drag (more accurately, CdA) change with body position is fascinating." This is a reminder that multimodal generative AI is not just about creating content, but also about analyzing it and understanding its properties.
*   Another commenter mentioned the nature of hypersonic wind tunnels, writing "Tests last only seconds and are more like explosions than wind". The nature of these tests suggests that the evaluation of safety may require testing in extreme conditions.

#### Summary
The article from Vox analyzes Donald Trump's relationship with other right-wing populist leaders around the world, arguing that despite some shared ideological affinities, Trump's foreign policy is not consistently aligned with their interests. While figures like Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Javier Milei of Argentina, and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have cultivated ties with the American right, they have not necessarily received preferential treatment from the Trump administration. Netanyahu, for example, was "aghast" when Trump engaged in direct negotiations with Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran, and visited the Middle East without including Israel. Similarly, Narendra Modi of India was "enraged" by Trump's remarks on the India-Pakistan conflict and criticism of Apple's move to manufacture iPhones in India. Even Orbán has maintained close economic ties with China, despite Trump's pressure to decouple. The author argues that Trump's foreign policy is primarily driven by the pursuit of "big deals and quick wins," rather than ideological alignment. The article concludes that Trump is unlikely to be remembered as the leader who made global far-right populism great again.

#### Why does this matter?
This article highlights the complex and often transactional nature of international relations, even among leaders with seemingly aligned political ideologies. It suggests that domestic political considerations and the pursuit of economic interests may outweigh ideological solidarity in shaping foreign policy decisions. It raises questions about the extent to which a shared label ("right-wing populist") actually translates into consistent cooperation or mutual support on the global stage.

#### Potential Insights for AI Research
This article doesn't directly discuss AI or related technologies. However, the discussion of global political trends and the rise of right-wing populism could be relevant to research on:

*   **Ethical AI, including safety, alignment, and societal impacts:** The rise of populism and its potential impact on democratic norms is relevant to discussions of AI governance, bias, and the potential for misuse of AI technologies in the political sphere.
*   **Misinformation/disinformation:** The article mentions the role of figures like Elon Musk in boosting far-right parties, which may be relevant to research on the spread of misinformation and the amplification of extremist views online.
